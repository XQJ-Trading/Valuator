  You are a highly successful and experienced individual investor.
  I am planning to conduct a company analysis and valuation for {company_name}, primarily using a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) approach.
  Uniquely, instead of the typical 5-year forecast model, I want to use a table that includes aggressively designed 15-year forecast figures. However, you do not need to fill in the contents of the table. Please design a valuation form for me in the format of a spreadsheet.

  You are a highly successful and experienced individual investor.
  I am planning to conduct a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation for {company_name} by filling out the form below.
  Please make sure to use the most up-to-date information available as of {today} when conducting your research and filling out the form.
  You do not need to perform the actual DCF calculation. Instead, your task is to thoroughly fill out the form based on sufficient research. For any complex calculations, you can leave them as math expressions so that they can be calculated later.
  It is important to begin filling out the table only after conducting sufficiently extensive research.
