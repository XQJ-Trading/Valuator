APAC also makes, markets, distributes and sells beverage concentrates, fountain syrups and finished goods under various beverage brands including 7UP, Aquafina, Mirinda, Mountain Dew, Pepsi and Sting Energy. These branded products are sold to authorized and independent bottlers, independent distributors and retailers. APAC also, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name).
Changes to Organizational Structure
The division amounts and discussions included in this Form 10-K reflect the reportable segments that existed through the end of 2024. Effective beginning with our first quarter of 2025, we realigned certain of
4
  
our reportable segments to be consistent with certain changes to our organizational structure and how the Chief Executive Officer will monitor the performance of these segments.
In North America, the food businesses, FLNA and QFNA, will be reported together as PepsiCo Foods North America. These changes do not impact our PBNA segment.
Internationally, the foods businesses in LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC will be reorganized into three reportable segments Latin America Foods, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Other International Foods. Other International Foods will include the foods businesses in APAC and India, currently part of AMESA.
Our international franchise beverage businesses that were part of our LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC segments will be reported as International Beverages Franchise.
The company-owned bottling businesses operating internationally are all located within EMEA and will be reported in the newly created EMEA segment.
Our historical segment reporting will be recast beginning first quarter 2025 to reflect the new organizational structure.
Our Distribution Network
Our products are primarily brought to market through DSD, customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.
Customer Warehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.
Distributor Networks
We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors.Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
E-commerce
Our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are acesulfame potassium, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, juice concentrates, nuts, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene
5
  
terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. During 2024, we continued to experience volatility in our commodity, packaging and other input costs, that may continue into fiscal 2025. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.
We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements did not have a material impact on our business or financial results. See Our Financial Results  Our Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights
We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Adrenaline Rush, Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Aqua Minerale, Arto Lifewtr, Baja Blast, BaiCaoWei, Bare, Bokomo, Bubly, Capn Crunch, Ceres, Cheetos, Chesters, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Evolve, Fast Twitch, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, Futurelife, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Gatorade Fit, Gatorade Zero, Gatorlyte, Grandmas, H2oh, Hard MTN Dew, Health Warrior, Imunele, J7, Kas, Kurkure, Lays, Life, Lifewtr, Liquifruit, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickies, Moirs, Mothers, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Game Fuel, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, Mug, Munchies, Muscle Milk, Near East, Obela, Off the Eaten Path, Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pearl Milling Company, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar, PopCorners, Pronutro, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Quaker Simply Granola, Rice-A-Roni, Rockstar, Rold Gold, Ruffles, Sabra, Sabritas, Safari, Sakata, Saladitas Gamesa, San Carlos, Sandora, Santitas, Sasko, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Siete, Simba, Smartfood, Smiths, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonrics, Spekko, Stacys, Starry, Starry Zero Sugar, Sting Energy, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers, Weetbix, Wheaten, White Star, Ya and Yachak. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute Celsius energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton and Starbucks. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBGs portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2024, we shifted our
6
  
alcoholic beverage business away from distribution to a trademark licensing model and flavor sales model and have licensed certain brands in certain markets in the United States and internationally. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.
Seasonality
Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discountdollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2024, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sams Club (Sams), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.

Our Competition
Our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, The Campbells Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellanova, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestl S.A., Primo Brands Corporation, Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.
Many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2024, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 18% and 21%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.
Our beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.
Research and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates development and improvement of our manufacturing processes, including reductions in cost and environmental footprint implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including legumes, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, dairy, protein (including plant-based proteins), fiber, micronutrients and hydration development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable, reusable or otherwise sustainable packaging development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business investments in technology and digitalization, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including
8
  
reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our environmental impact in our operations throughout our value chain.
Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods.
Regulatory Matters
The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products and their ingredients, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety and food labeling the Food Safety Modernization Act the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health and safety various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act the Federal Trade Commission Act the Lanham Act and various state law statutory and common law duties regarding false advertising various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act and the Clayton Act various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act) customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools laws regulating the ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.
We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety the ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products, including the Food (Promotion and Placement)(England) Regulations international trade, importexport restrictions and tariffs supply chains, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act occupational health and safety competition and anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
9
  
Certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounceliter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our snack products are sold have either imposed or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our snack products as a result of ingredients (such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat) contained in our products.
Certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or packaging materials, the audience to whom products are marketed or the location in which the products are sold. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold, limit the location in which our products may be available or discontinue the use of certain ingredients. We expect continued scrutiny of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products andor their packaging and it is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
Certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates, encourage waste reduction, restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging or to carry warnings about the environmental impact of plastic packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, we are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities. Our operations outside the United States are subject to similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce emissions to mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that aim to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or that aim to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition,
10
  
we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses or properties acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see also Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Human Capital
PepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is critical to our long-term success. Our Board of Directors (Board) and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of human capital management topics, including corporate culture, pay equity, health and safety, training and development and compensation and benefits.
We employed approximately 319,000 people worldwide as of December 28, 2024, including approximately 134,000 people within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCos top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emerging technologies to protect our employees from injuries, including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology, resulting in reductions in road traffic incidents, and deploying ergonomic and machine safety risk reduction solutions.
We believe that our culture is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continually strive to improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we serve.
We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees leadership and professional skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our internal global online learning resource. In 2024, PepsiCo employees completed over 1.8 million hours of training.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future.
Business Risks
Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business.
Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns, diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, increasing use of weight-loss drugs or other factors) and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels) pricing (including the effective impact of taxes imposed on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients contained in such products) changes in consumer spending patterns (including if consumers switch to private label or lower-priced product offerings) product quality concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging) concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) and concerns or perceptions regarding our workforce policies and initiatives. Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks and geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products, including negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events. These and other factors have reduced and could continue to reduce consumers willingness to purchase certain of our products, including as a result of public boycotts. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues.
12
  
Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.
Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including any failure by us, our business partners, or other actors in our supply chain to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor, workforce policies and initiatives, workplace conditions and employee health and safety any failure, or perception of a failure, to achieve or make sufficient progress toward our environmental, social and governance goals, or any revisions of or negative perception toward such goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, packaging, water use, our impact on the environment and our workforce policies and initiatives any failure to address health or other concerns about our products, products we distribute, certain brands licensed to and distributed to third parties (including alcoholic beverages), or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products are ultra-processed or otherwise contribute to obesity and other health conditions or an increase in public health costs our research and development efforts any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products any failure to comply with laws and regulations consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, or catastrophic events or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.
Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.
We have recalled, and could in the future recall, products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Joint ventures in which we have an interest have also recalled, and could in the future recall, products for the same or other reasons. Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory, customer fines and returns or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, our manufacturing facilities and products have been and could continue to be subject to increased inspection by federal, state and local authorities. Product quality or safety issues identified by us or governmental authorities have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, including as a result of temporary or permanent closure of manufacturing plants or facilities, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines andor judgments, cleaning and remediation costs and legal fees, and costs associated with alternative sources of production) and damage our reputation (or the reputation of joint ventures in which we have an interest), particularly as we or our joint ventures continue to expand into new categories, all of which can adversely affect our business. Any perception or allegation (whether or not valid) of failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations, inspections or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of product recalls, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
13
  
Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business.
Our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space and preferable shelf placement, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively digitalize our operations and adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively or effectively than we do, if our competitors are more successful than us in shifting to products that are less effected by the impact of taxes imposed as a result of ingredients contained in such products, or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures.
Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce can have an adverse effect on our business.
Our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and changing worker expectations regarding flexible work models. Any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing, artificial intelligence and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates in a manner that supports our culture can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.
Water scarcity can adversely affect our business.
We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, actions by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, can lead to supply chain disruption adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners higher compliance costs increased capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption) higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners failure to achieve our goals relating to water use perception of our failure to act responsibly with
14
  
respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business.
Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business.
The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities.
The retail industry is also impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result of increased consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America. In this changing retail landscape, retailers and buying groups have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions by demanding lower prices or increased promotional programs, removing our products or otherwise reducing shelf space allocated to our products and focusing on introducing and developing private-label brands. The increasing power of retailers and consolidation may also adversely impact our other customers ability to compete effectively in the market in which they operate, which may in turn affect orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers to compete effectively. Our inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers has adversely affected and c an continue to adversely affect our business.
Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.
We have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing war and other military conflict, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions also pose physical risks to our facilities and those of our suppliers, which could impair our production capabilities and disrupt our supply chain. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to mitigate disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products or from operational or financial instability of our key suppliers. Any sustained or significant disruption in the future to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.
The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural
15
  
disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, labor shortages or changes in availability of our or our business partners workforce, strikes or work stoppages (including by railway workers or other third parties involved in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products), governmental incentives and controls and importexport restrictions, such as new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Canada and Mexico and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. Even as certain inflationary pressures moderated, we continued to experience volatility in our commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2024, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.
Political, social and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business.
Political, social and geopolitical conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns), geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East) in these markets have in the past impacted and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to the negotiation of new trade agreements, new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products or ingredients (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Canada and Mexico and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries), sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters. Such conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty and heightened risk to employee safety, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) could result in temporary or permanent loss of assets, including the nationalization or expropriation of assets.
In addition, political and social conditions in certain jurisdictions have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with geopolitical events and tensions, political elections, civil rights and liberties. Our operations or the operations of our business partners, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business.
Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, regulation, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the
16
  
future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions geopolitical conflicts or tensions, acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests competition tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets foreign ownership restrictions nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products highly inflationary economies devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets.
Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.
Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as high inflation and adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates, including as a result of geopolitical events and tensions. These uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in recessions or economic slowdowns volatile commodity markets labor shortages highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency contraction in the availability of credit austerity or stimulus measures the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs andor funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or shifting toward lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which has impacted and could continue to impact consumer demand for our products. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.
Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business.
We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers ordering and managing inventory managing and operating our facilities protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be
17
  
subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents.
Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may increase our cybersecurity risks, including generative artificial intelligence augmenting threat actors technological sophistication to enhance existing or create new malware. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, deepfake attacks and disinformation campaigns, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure (including zero-day vulnerabilities), hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. Continued geopolitical instability has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. In addition, such cyberattacks may be difficult to detect for periods of time and, even if detected, the nature and extent of that cybersecurity incident may not be immediately clear and an investigation into a cybersecurity incident could take a significant amount of time to complete. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, complete and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident to customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, compromises of personal data, confidential information, intellectual property or other sensitive data, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers. In addition, these risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems.
Similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of various busin ess processes and activities, including procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, information technology support services and administrative functions (including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions) and the systems managed, hosted, provided andor used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware and exploit known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to address issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.
Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we believe we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery,
18
  
employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business.
We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, including our recent acquisition of Garza Food Ventures LLC (Siete), is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures operating through new business models or in new categories or territories motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and data protection and cybersecurity) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, food safety, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws) retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers managing tax costs or inefficiencies maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses recognition of impairment charges in connection with potential divestitures managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business. In addition, failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions may impede our efforts to shift our portfolio to include new products that are less affected by the impact of ingredient-based taxes or other regulatory actions.
Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business.
We rely on third-party service providers, including software and cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, information technology support services and administrative functions (such as payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions). Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties,
19
  
remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business.
In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain aspects of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have deployed these systems in certain countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected.
Climate change or measures to address climate change and other sustainability matters can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation.
Climate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions, including rising temperatures and drought. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, climate change or other weather-related disruptions to our supply chain may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations.
In addition, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our sustainability goal, which will require significant effort and resources from us and other stakeholders, such as our suppliers and other third parties, governmental entities, and the development of technology that may not currently exist or exist at scale. Further, developing and collecting, measuring and reporting sustainability information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to changing interpretive guidance and evolving reporting standards, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive in the European Union, especially to the extent these standards are not harmonized or consistent. Further, methodologies for reporting our data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures) and other changes in circumstances. Lack of progress or failure to properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change and other sustainability matters, including the use of single-use plastics, has led and could continue to lead to adverse publicity, which could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation and increased the risk of litigation, regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, which has adversely affected our business. We could also be subjected to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or certain stakeholders (such as boycotts, litigation or negative publicity campaigns) that could adversely affect our business.
20
  
Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer.
Many of our employees and employees of third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production or distribution of our products are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we or the third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or the ingredients, raw materials or commodities used in our products, interrupt product supply, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business.
Financial Risks
Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives or organizational restructurings can adversely affect our financial performance.
Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including digitalization of our operations, our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models and organizational restructuring. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures could result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives, digitalization of our operations or organizational restructurings as planned or do not achieve expected savings or efficiencies as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance.
A deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business or investments can result in impairment charges that adversely affect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable intangible assets, equity method investments, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments in available-for-sale debt securities, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. Our equity method investees also perform similar impairment tests and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them, adjusted for the impact of items such as basis differences and deferred taxes, as appropriate. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions, or those of our equity method investees, regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, geopolitical conditions (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), macroeconomic conditions, including the interest rate environment, or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, as well as our ability to hold the investment until recovery of fair value to amortized cost for available-for-sale debt securities, have resulted and could in the future result in an impairment charge (including the impairments of our investment in TBG), thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.
21
  
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions or geopolitical instability have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.
Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.
Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks
Taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our beverage products as a result of ingredients contained in such products. These taxes vary in scope and form some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounceliter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Italy enacted a flat tax on all non-alcoholic beverages, effective July 1, 2025, at a rate of 0.10 Euro (0.11 U.S. dollars) per liter for drinks with a sweetener content higher than 25g per liter. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our snack products are sold, have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our snack products as a result of ingredients (such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat) contained in such products. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products or product packaging. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product or product packaging, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in
22
  
our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold (including bans on advertising during childrens TV programs), limit the location in which our products may be available (including limits on the sale of our products in public schools) or discontinue the use of certain ingredients or packaging. For example, in 2023 the U.K. restricted promotion and in-store placement of high in fat, sugar or salt products and in 2024, the state of California enacted a regulation banning artificial colors in products sold in K-12 public schools effective in 2027. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products, and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., are evaluating restrictions on ultra-processed foods. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past reduced and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance.
We rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. However, not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure, improper disposal or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation, government investigations or other action or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws, regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction, increased recycling rates or decreased use of single-use plastics or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These laws, regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, minimum recycled content requirements, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing PFAS, restrictions on labeling related to recyclability, requirements to charge deposit fees and requirements to scale reusable or refillable packaging. For example, the European Union, Peru, South Africa and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past increased and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or other materials used in our packaging, to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance.
Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business.
We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, as well as similar legislation enacted in other states, as well as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the
23
  
GDPR into U.K. law), Chinas Personal Information Protection Act and similar regulations implemented in other non-U.S. jurisdictions, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions continue to adopt similar regulations and we continue to expand our direct-to-consumer operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business.
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance.
Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation. For example, numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development model (OECD) rules that propose a partial global profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Certain countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation incorporating the global minimum tax with effect from 2024 and widespread implementation of a global minimum tax is expected by the end of 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can materially differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.
If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, our use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content. Such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use andor sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.

Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business.
The conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, processing, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, supply chain (including human rights), traceability, sourcing (including pesticide use), packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental, social and governance matters and reporting (including climate change), machine learning and artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition and antitrust laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements, including expanded disclosure requirements that are expected to continue to expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Further, the legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies in one or more of our businesses. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations (or allegations thereof) can subject us to criminal or civil investigations or enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, increasing governmental attention to certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials as well as the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of such ingredients or substances have resulted in and could continue to result in increased regulatory scrutiny and our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business.
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business.
We and our subsidiaries have been, and in the future may be, party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, food safety, personal injury, property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters, including concerns or perceptions regarding our packaging and its environmental impact, the efficacy of recycling, our packaging sustainability goals and our workforce policies and initiatives, and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur
25
  
significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2024 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. In response, we have implemented cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our efforts to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks. Our enterprise risk management framework considers cybersecurity risk alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process. Our enterprise risk management team collaborates with our Information Security function, led by the Companys Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and the Companys Chief Information Security Officer, to gather insights for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threat risks, their severity, and potential mitigations.
We assess PepsiCos Information Security program using an industry-leading cybersecurity framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. To help assess and identify our cybersecurity risks, we maintain internal resources to perform penetration testing designed to simulate evolving tactics and techniques of real-world threat actors, engage with industry partners and law enforcement and intelligence communities and conduct tabletop exercises and periodic risk interviews across our business. We also engage an independent third party to perform internal and external penetration testing of PepsiCos environment periodically and engage other third parties to periodically conduct assessments of our cybersecurity capabilities. In addition, we continue to expand training and awareness practices to mitigate human risk, including mandatory computer-based training, internal communications, and regular phishing awareness campaigns that are designed to emulate real-world contemporary threats and provide immediate feedback (and, if necessary, additional training or remedial action) to employees.
Our processes also address cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers. We proactively evaluate the cybersecurity risk of a third party by utilizing a repository of risk assessments, external monitoring sources, threat intelligence and predictive analytics to better inform PepsiCo during contracting and vendor selection processes. Additionally, we require those third parties to agree by contract to implement appropriate security controls. Security issues are documented and tracked and periodic monitoring is conducted for third parties in order to mitigate risk.
In addition to the processes, technologies, and controls that we have in place to reduce the likelihood of a successful material cyberattack, the Company has established well-defined response procedures to address cyber events that do occur. The program provides for the coordination of various corporate functions and governance groups and serves as a framework for the execution of responsibilities across businesses and operational roles. Our incident response plan coordinates the activities we take to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to triage, assess severity for, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate the incident, as well as to assess for potential disclosure, comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage. We also maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures.
Based on the information we have as of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially
26
  
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information about these risks.
Cybersecurity Governance
Cybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In 2021, the Board amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines to specifically mention cybersecurity as an area of Board oversight to reflect this existing practice.The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management, including from the Companys Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and the Companys Chief Information Security Officer, regarding cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity, results from third-party assessments, and also discusses any significant cyber incidents, including recent incidents at other companies and the emerging threat landscape.
Our cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, which are discussed in greater detail above, are led by the Companys Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and the Companys Chief Information Security Officer.Such individuals have significant prior work experience in various roles across multiple industries involving managing information security, developing cybersecurity strategy, implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs and managing compliance environments.
These members of management are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan.

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
PepsiCo is a leading global food and beverage company with a diverse and complementary portfolio of brands such as Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. We operate through various channels, including authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers, and other third parties, to produce, market, distribute, and sell a wide array of beverages and convenient foods. Our reach extends to customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.
As a global company with strong local connections, we faced many of the same challenges in 2024 as our consumers, customers, and competitors worldwide. These included ongoing supply chain disruptions, persistent inflationary pressures, evolving consumer preferences and behaviors, an intensely competitive business environment, the continued expansion of e-commerce in a rapidly changing retail landscape, ongoing macroeconomic and political volatility, and an increasingly complex regulatory environment.
In response to these challenges, we have continued to adapt and innovate, reinforcing our resilience and continued focus on growth. We are focused on improving our productivity, optimizing our operations and harnessing our scale and capabilities across our markets, and further elevating the needs, occasions, and channels of consumers in our strategies to lead and shape the future of our categories. This is underpinned by our pep (PepsiCo Positive) transformation, now in its fourth year.
A Strategy for the Future pep is our strategy to transform our company to create sustainable growth and value  today, tomorrow, and many years into the future. It is the way we are transforming our supply chain, evolving our portfolio, and making sure we have the right capabilities to support our people and our business throughout the world.
As a food and agricultural leader, we are working to help farmers adapt to climate change through investments in regenerative agriculture, training programs, and innovative technologies. We are operating net-zero water and energy facilities across many markets, electrifying our transport fleets, and accelerating the use of recycled plastics, so we can try to build a more sustainable business while reducing operational costs. Our leadership in regenerative agriculture not only supports farmers and the planet, but also strengthens our supply chain, helping us become more resilient while positioning us to deliver long-term value for shareholders. And thanks to the diversification across our portfolio, our categories, and the geographies in which we operate, we are better equipped to capitalize on opportunities across a wide range of consumer needs.
Our pep initiatives and ambitions are geared toward driving growth across every aspect of our operations, so that we can strengthen our business and deliver more value for our stakeholders.
Transforming Our Portfolio Our consumer-centric portfolio transformation revolves around three key elements our work to evolve our recipes to reduce sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar, while
34
  
incorporating more diverse ingredients our efforts to find innovative ways to deliver new occasions and engagements for consumers across our existing portfolio and the strategic acquisition of brands that help us incorporate new and complementary foods and beverages into our portfolio.
Bringing Our Business Closer to the Consumer We are continuously making investments that aim to help us provide consumers with more value, more personalization, and more choices. We will continue to innovate to create foods, beverages, and experiences that meet consumer needs without compromising the taste or quality they expect.
We are making changes to our organization to help us further increase productivity, sharpen our focus on growth and value, and create opportunities to better harness the expertise and scale of our food and beverage operations across markets. In the United States, we are reorganizing our U.S. Foods and Beverages businesses into one unified North America Region to harness scale, unlock synergies, and accelerate growth through category-leading brands and innovative products. Internationally, we are realigning our international beverages and foods businesses to ensure each category is distinctly managed and has the right resources and capabilities to meet the unique needs of consumers in every market.
North America Business As part of the changes to our organizational structure, were working to enhance our connection with North American consumers, bringing sales and consumer insights closer together, so we can identify and act efficiently on shifts in demand. Combining supply chain operations allows us to harness scale, reduce duplication, and create a more cohesive system for managing inventory and logistics, thereby optimizing our go-to-market strategy and helping drive consistent best practices across the business.
At the same time, the company is focused on expanding our better-for-you offerings and product innovations in both foods and drinks to meet evolving consumer preferences. Through advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, we are optimizing our supply chain, reducing waste, and improving speed to market. These steps ensure the company operates with more precision while protecting margins in an inflationary environment. The immediate focus is on meeting consumer needs, operational excellence, competing for market share, and maintaining agility and resilience. These efforts are foundational to the North America business and driving near-term growth, while setting the stage for long-term success.
Productivity Fuels our Ability to Perform In 2024, we delivered record productivity. Increases in automation in our plants and warehouses have empowered frontline decision-making, improved optimization across our transportation and fleet networks, and allowed greater focus on cost management and waste elimination. These efforts fuel our ability to reinvest in our brands and capabilities, so that we are well-positioned to support areas in which our business is performing well, while simultaneously allowing us to develop in new ways across our markets and our categories.
Focus on Growth We remain focused on delivering growth and fueling innovation by driving positive action for people and the planet. By improving our productivity and aligning our operations and strategy to meet consumer needs, we aim to be well positioned to navigate the complexities of the global market and deliver sustainable, long-term value to our consumers and stakeholders.

Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain
During 2024, we continued to experience higher operating costs, including on transportation and labor costs, which may continue in 2025. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including volatile geopolitical conditions, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and labor costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers, which may result in reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.
See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.
Risks Associated with Climate Change
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.
Risks Associated with International Operations
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented in this report, volatile economic, political, social and geopolitical conditions, civil unrest and wars and other military conflicts, acts of terrorism and natural disasters and other catastrophic events in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, continue to result in challenging operating environments and have resulted in and could continue to result in changes in how we operate in certain of these markets. Debt and credit issues, currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from certain markets), as well as the threat or imposition of new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Canada and Mexico and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries), sanctions or export controls have also continued to impact our operations in certain of these international markets. We continue to closely monitor the
36
  
economic, operating and political environment in the markets in which we operate, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs and currency devaluation, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
Our operations in Russia accounted for 4% of our consolidated net revenue for each of the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. Russia accounted for 3% and 3% of our consolidated assets, 10% and 6% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents, and 41% and 35% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue for each of the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and of our consolidated assets as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.
See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of i mpairment and other charges recognized in the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.
Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our snack products are sold have either imposed or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our snack products as a result of ingredients (such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat) contained in our products.
We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We expect continued scrutiny of certain ingredients and substances present in certain of our products and packaging. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
OECD Global Minimum Tax
Numerous countries, including European Union member states, have enacted, or are expected to enact, legislation incorporating the OECD model rules for a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Widespread implementation is expected by the end of 2025, with certain countries that have not yet enacted potentially applying the legislation as of a retroactive date. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.
37
  
Retail Landscape
Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
The retail industry also continues to be impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America. We have seen and expect to continue to see retailers and buying groups impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions. We continue to monitor our relationships with retailers and buying groups and seek to identify actions we may take to maintain mutually beneficial relationships and resolve any significant disputes and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
See also Item 1A. Risk Factors, Executive Overview above and Market Risks below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Companys operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following
PepsiCos Board has oversight responsibility for PepsiCos integrated risk management framework. One of the Boards primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Companys business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Companys top risks. Throughout the year, the Board and relevant Committees of the Board receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk management issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater detail, including risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, human capital management and supply chain and commodity inflation. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding the Companys top risks, including updates from members of management responsible for overseeing impacted areas (for example, the Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer and Chief Information Security Officer), governance processes associated with managing these risks, the status of projects to strengthen the Companys risk mitigation efforts and recent incidents impacting the industry and threat landscape. Given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider short-, medium- and long-term potential impacts on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations, including looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers and emerging trends, and considers the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Companys risk mitigation efforts. The Board receives updates through presentations, memos and other written materials, teleconferences and other appropriate means of communication, with numerous opportunities for discussion and feedback, and continuously evaluates its approach in addressing top risks as circumstances evolve. For
38
  
example, as part of risk updates to the Board and relevant Committees during 2024, the Board or its relevant Committee were provided updates on the impact of disruptive events, including geopolitical events and tensions in certain international markets, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Board also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and conditions that may impact the Companys strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, labor market trends, changing consumer behavior, retail disruption and digitalization.
The Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.
The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCos risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Boards oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo. The Audit Committee also assists the Boards oversight of the Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Chief Compliance  Ethics Officer, who reports to the General Counsel, meets regularly with the Audit Committee, including in executive session without management present
The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCos employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Companys governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning and
The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCos policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, and public policy matters.
The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC) meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board and designated Committees. The PRC is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCos Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Sector Chief Executive Officers, and the heads of Enterprise Risk, Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Research  Development, Information Technology, Sustainability, Strategy, Transformation, International Beverages, Commercial, Global Operations and Marketing
Division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks
PepsiCos Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCos Board, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board
PepsiCos Internal Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures and
39
  
PepsiCos Compliance  Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.
PepsiCos Disclosure Committee, comprised of the General Counsel, Controller and heads of Internal Audit, Financial Planning  Analysis and Investor Relations, evaluates information from PepsiCos integrated risk management framework as part of the Disclosure Committees monitoring of the integrity and effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. PepsiCos risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.
Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in
commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy
foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions and
interest rates.
In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of our market risks.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is impacted by changes in market conditions, including interest rates and inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions. See Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intangible assets and pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.
Commodity Prices
Our commodity derivative contracts had a total notional value of 1.4 billion as of December 28, 2024 and 1.7 billion as of December 30, 2023. At the end of 2024, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by 140 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, collectively, comprising approximately 25% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2024, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue performance by 1.5 percentage points,
40
  
primarily due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Russian ruble, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.
Our foreign exchange derivative contracts had a total notional value of 3.1 billion as of December 28, 2024 and 3.8 billion as of December 30, 2023. At the end of 2024, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2024 by 319 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.
Our cross-currency swap contracts had a total notional value of 1.2 billion as of December 28, 2024 and 1.3 billion as of December 30, 2023. At the end of 2024, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by 107 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.
The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was 2.9 billion as of December 28, 2024 and 3.0 billion as of December 30, 2023.
Interest Rates
Our interest rate swap contracts had a total notional value of 2.0 billion as of December 28, 2024. Assuming year-end 2024 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2024 by 32 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.
OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS
Results of Operations  Consolidated Review
Volume
Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Unit volume performance adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Further, unit volume performance excludes the impact of a 53 rd reporting week, where applicable. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional reporting week every five or six years (53 rd reporting week).
Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under
41
  
the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks.
Convenient food volume includes volume sold by us and our noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group. In December 2024, we acquired the Strauss Groups 50% ownership in Sabra and Sabra became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit
2024 2023 Change
Net revenue91,85491,471%
Operating profit12,88711,986 8%
Operating margin 14.0%13.1%0.9
See Results of Operations  Division Review for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
Operating profit increased 8% and operating margin improved 0.9 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing, productivity savings and an 18-percentage-point impact of prior-year impairment charges related to the SodaStream business. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a decline in organic volume, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher impairment and other charges associated with our TBG investment and Juice Transaction-related receivables, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher restructuring charges and a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an indirect tax reserve. Corporate unallocated expenses reflect a 3-percentage-point favorable impact driven primarily by a decrease in corporate expenses and prior-year contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc.

Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense increased 272 million, primarily reflecting higher settlement charges due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees and the purchase of a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future benefit payments for certain retirees.
Net interest expense and other increased 100 million, primar ily due to higher interest rates on debt and higher average debt balances, partially offset by higher average cash balances and higher interest rates on average cash balances.
The reported tax rate decreased 0.4 percentage points, primarily reflecting a reduction in the state tax rate.

Non-GAAP Measures
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees.We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business.We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends.Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash) charges related to restructuring plans charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures gains associated with divestitures asset impairment charges (non-cash) product recall-related impact pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes amounts related to the resolution of tax positions tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and Items Affecting Comparability for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.
47
  
The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits expenseincome, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share  diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, impairment and other chargescredits, product recall-related impact, indirect tax expense related to an international audit and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see Items Affecting Comparability for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share  diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
Organic revenue performance
We define organic revenue performance as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue performance provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
See Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Performance in Results of Operations  Division Review for further information.
Free cash flow
We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
See Free Cash Flow in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.
48
  
Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability
We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability,provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.
See Return on Invested Capital in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, metals, and energy. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
The 2019 Productivity Plan leverages new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes re-engineers our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market and simplifies our organization and optimizes our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we further expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2030 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur
50
  
pre-tax charges of approximately 6.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately 5.1 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately 3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately 2.9 billion. Plan to date through December 28, 2024, we have incurred pre-tax charges of 2.6 billion, including cash expenditures of 1.9 billion. In our 2025 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately 900 million, including cash expenditures of approximately 800 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures through 2027, with the balance to be incurred through 2030. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs.
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include transaction expenses, such as consulting, advisory and other professional fees, and merger and integration charges. Merger and integration charges include employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs.
See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.
Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges
In connection with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs in 2022. We also recognized adjustments to these charges in 2023.
See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges
We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of managements decision to reposition or discontinue the saledistribution of certain brands and to sell an investment in 2022. We also recognized adjustments to these charges in 2023.
See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Other Impairment Charges
We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in TBG. In addition, we recorded allowance for expected credit losses related to outstanding receivables from TBG associated with the Juice Transaction.
See Notes 1, 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Product Recall-Related Impact
We recognized product returns, inventory write-offs and customer and consumer-related costs in our QFNA division associated with a voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
51
  
Indirect Tax Impact
We recognized additional expenses related to an indirect tax reserve in our LatAm division.
Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact
Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees and the purchase of a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future benefit payments for certain retirees. The settlement charge was triggered when the aggregate of the cumulative lump sum distributions and the annuity contract premium exceeded the total annual service and interest costs. Pension and retiree medical-related impact also includes curtailment losses due to restructuring actions as part of our 2019 Productivity Plan.
See Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Our Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations,proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments payments for acquisitions operating leases purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act). In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our Business Risks and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
As of December 28, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of December 28, 2024, our mandatory transition tax liability was 1.7 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act we currently expect to pay approximately 772 million of this liability in 2025. Any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.
Supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net cash used for investing activities(5,472)(5,495)
Net cash used for financing activities(7,556)(3,009)
Operating Activities
In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 12.5 billion, compared to 13.4 billion in the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons.
Investing Activities
In 2024, net cash used for investing activities was 5.5 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of 5.0 billion.
In 2023, net cash used for investing activities was 5.5 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of 5.3 billion.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division and see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.
We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.
Financing Activities
In 2024, net cash used for financing activities was 7.6 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of 8.2 billion, as well as payments of long-term debt borrowings of 3.9 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt of 4.0 billion.
In 2023, net cash used for financing activities was 3.0 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of 7.7 billion, as well as payments of long-term debt borrowings of 3.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of 5.5 billion and net proceeds from short-term borrowings of 2.3 billion.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.
We annually review our capital structure with our Board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to 10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 4, 2025, we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to 5.69 per share from 5.42 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2025. We expect to return a total of approximately 8.6 billion to shareholders in 2025, comprising dividends of approximately 7.6 billion and share repurchases of approximately 1.0 billion.

We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Our Business Risks for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our Business Risks and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
An appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including the business and economic uncertainty resulting from volatile geopolitical conditions and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.
55
  
Our critical accounting policies and estimates are
revenue recognition
goodwill and other intangible assets
income tax expense and accruals and
pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. Our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in Our Customers in Item 1. Business, we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and
56
  
are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture andor distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with managements strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time.
57
  
Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. Additionally, indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions are more susceptible to impairment because they are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Our Business Risks.
As of December 28, 2024, the estimated fair value of the SodaStream reporting unit narrowly exceeded its carrying value. Given the low coverage, there could be further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream reporting unit goodwill if future sales and operating profit results are not in line with the forecasted future cash flows of the business andor if macroeconomic conditions worsen and drive an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate its fair value. We continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream reporting unit, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Income Tax Expense and Accruals
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.
An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction
58
  
in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.
In 2024, our annual tax rate was 19.4% compared to 19.8% in 2023. See Other Consolidated Results for further information.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Pension and Retiree Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
See Items Affecting Comparability and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.
Our Assumptions
The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components (1)the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2)the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3)other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4)the expected return on assets for our funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include
certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality
the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans and
the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.
Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and managements best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
59
  
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows
2025 2024 2023
Pension
Service cost discount rate 6.0%5.4%5.5%
Interest cost discount rate 5.4%5.1%5.4%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.1%7.0%7.0%
Retiree medical
Service cost discount rate 5.6%5.1%5.4%
Interest cost discount rate 5.2%5.0%5.3%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.1%7.1%7.1%
In 2024, the aggregate of lump sum distributions and the purchase of a group annuity contract exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered pre-tax settlement charges for certain U.S. defined pension plans. In addition, we expect the recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by higher discount rates, to increase our pension and retiree medical expense in 2025.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 100-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2025 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows
Assumption Amount
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense74
Expected rate of return143
Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.
We made a discretionary contribution of 250 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2025.
Our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1  Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from volatile geopolitical conditions and changes in the interest rate and inflationary cost environment have made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53 rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule
Quarter United States and Canada International
First Quarter 12 weeks January and February
Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May
Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August
Fourth Quarter 16 weeks (17 weeks for 2022)September, October, November and December
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
67
  
Our Divisions
We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows
1)Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada
2)Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada
3)PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada
4)Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America
5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe
6)Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia and
7)Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.
Changes to Organizational Structure
The division amounts and discussions included in this Form 10-K reflect the reportable segments that existed through the end of 2024. Effective beginning with our first quarter of 2025, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with certain changes to our organizational structure and how the Chief Executive Officer will monitor the performance of these segments.
In North America, the food businesses, FLNA and QFNA, will be reported together as PepsiCo Foods North America. These changes do not impact our PBNA segment.
Internationally, the foods businesses in LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC will be reorganized into three reportable segments Latin America Foods, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Other International Foods. Other International Foods will include the foods businesses in APAC and India, currently part of AMESA.
Our international franchise beverage businesses that were part of our LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC segments will be reported as International Beverages Franchise.
The company-owned bottling businesses operating internationally are all located within EMEA and will be reported in the newly created EMEA segment.
Our historical segment reporting will be recast beginning first quarter 2025 to reflect the new organizational structure.
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil.
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies
share-based compensation expense
pension and retiree medical expense and
derivatives.
68
  
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
Pension and Retiree Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
Derivatives
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, metals, and energy. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
Net Revenue, Significant Expenses and Operating Profit(Loss) by Division
Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses division operating profit(loss) as the profit measure to evaluate division performance and allocate resources across divisions. Corporate unallocated expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)income and net interest expense and other are centrally managed costs and are therefore excluded from this profit measure to provide better transparency of our division operating results. Our CODM considers variances of actual performance to our annual operating plan and periodic forecasts when making decisions.
Significant expenses are expenses which are regularly provided to the CODM and are included in division operating profit(loss). These consist of segment cost of sales, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and various items affecting comparability. Segment cost of sales includes raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, excluding the impact of items affecting comparability. Segment selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs to execute sales to customers, distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, costs related to brand and product marketing to consumers, other ongoing operating costs that are not directly related to manufacturing, distribution, selling, advertising or marketing activities as well as other income or expense items, excluding the impact of items affecting comparability. Items affecting comparability include restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, impairment and other chargescredits, product recall-related impact, indirect tax impact and gain associated with the Juice Transaction.
Asset and other balance sheet information for divisions is not provided to the CODM.

Disaggregation of Net Revenue
Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following table reflects the percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue

Long-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets, investments in noncontrolled affiliates and other investments included in other assets. These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used. See Notes 2 and 15 for further information on property, plant and equipment. See Notes 2 and 4 for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets. See Notes 9 and 15 for further information on other assets.
Corporate Unallocated Expenses
Corporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain gains and losses on equity investments, as well as certain other items.
Note 2  Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and
74
  
administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.
The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. Our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2024, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sams) represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of 237 million as of December 28, 2024 and 228 million as of December 30, 2023 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.
75
  
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim periods actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.
Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled 5.9 billion in 2024, 5.7 billion in 2023 and 5.2 billion in 2022, including advertising expenses of 3.9 billion in 2024, 3.8 billion in 2023 and 3.5 billion in 2022. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of
media and personal service prepayments
promotional materials in inventory and
production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of 58 million and 67 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were 16.0 billion in 2024, 15.4 billion in 2023 and 15.0 billion in 2022.
Software Costs
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1)external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2)compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3)interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled 199 million in 2024, 159 million in 2023 and 123 million in 2022. Net capitalized software and development costs were 1.5 billion and 1.4 billion as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.
Research and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were 813 million, 804 million and
76
  
771 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with managements strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 4 for further information.

For inventories valued under the LIFO method, the differences between the LIFO and FIFO methods of valuing inventories are not material.
Property, Plant and Equipment  Note 15. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an assets estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.
Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries  Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity as currency translation adjustment.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance disclosure of expenses of a public entitys reportable segments. The new guidance requires a public entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis (1) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (2) an amount for other segment items (the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss), including a description of its composition, and (3) information about a reportable segments (a) profit or loss, and (b) assets, if provided to CODM, and on an annual basis, the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources. The new guidance also clarifies that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segments profit or loss, one or more of those measures may be reported and requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in the guidance and all existing segment disclosures. We adopted the guidance in our 2024 annual reporting, on a retrospective basis. See Note 1 for further information.
In September 2022, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which we adopted in our 2024 annual reporting, on a prospective basis. See Note 14 for further information.
Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance to improve the disclosure of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The new guidance requires a public entity to provide tabular disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of amounts for the following expense categories (1) purchases of inventory, (2) employee compensation, (3) depreciation and (4) intangible asset amortization, as included in each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement that contains any of the expense categories noted. Additionally, on an annual and interim basis, a qualitative description is required for amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. The guidance also requires certain amounts that are
78
  
currently required to be disclosed to be included in the same tabular disclosure as these disaggregation requirements. Furthermore, on an annual and interim basis, a public entity is required to separately disclose selling expenses and annually, disclose a description of the selling expenses. The guidance is effective for 2027 annual reporting, and in the first quarter of 2028 for interim reporting, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2027 annual reporting and each quarter thereafter, on a prospective basis.
In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance transparency of income tax disclosures. On an annual basis, the new guidance requires a public entity to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) additional information for reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) by the applicable statutory income tax rate, (3) income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with foreign taxes disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid, (4) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign, and (5) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated between federal (national), state and foreign. The guidance is effective for fiscal year 2025 annual reporting, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2025 annual reporting, on a prospective basis.
Note 3  Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
The 2019 Productivity Plan leverages new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes re-engineers our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market and simplifies our organization and optimizes our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we further expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2030 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately 6.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately 5.1 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately 3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately 2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows

Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible assets estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 28, 2024 and using average 2024 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows
2025 2026 2027 2028 2029
Five-year projected amortization7364605958
Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
As discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third quarter. The annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2024, based on best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, did not result in any material impairment charges.
As of December 28, 2024, the estimated fair value of the SodaStream reporting unit narrowly exceeded its carrying value. Given the low coverage, there could be further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream reporting unit goodwill if future sales and operating profit results are not in line with the forecasted future cash flows of the business andor if macroeconomic conditions worsen and drive an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate its fair value. We continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream reporting unit, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the year ended December 28, 2024.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, macroeconomic conditions, including higher interest rates, inflationary costs, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and recent business performance indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for certain of our intangible assets, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of 0.6 billion (0.5 billion after-tax or 0.35 per share) for brands and 0.3 billion (0.3 billion after-tax or 0.22 per share) for goodwill, both in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand and reporting unit in our Europe division, in the year ended December 30, 2023. See Note 1 for further information.
In the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of 241 million (193 million after-tax or 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.
In the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the
82
  
weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflected the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of 1.2 billion (958 million after-tax or 0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflected the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions).As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of 1.6 billion (1.3 billion after-tax or 0.94 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
In 2022, we recorded 86 million (0.06 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of correlating adjustments related to a partial audit settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2019.
As of December 28, 2024, our mandatory transition tax liability was 1.7 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by 579 million in 2024, and 309 million in each of 2023 and 2022. We currently expect to pay approximately 772 million of this liability in 2025.
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.
Other Tax Matters
On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016 and requested an appeals conference. In 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of 233 million (0.17 per share) in 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.
In 2024 and 2023, tax benefits of 54 million (0.04 per share) and 68 million (0.05 per share), respectively, were recorded related to the impairment of certain consolidated investments.

Reserves
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows
Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit
United States 2014-2023 2014-2019
Mexico 2014-2023 2014-2019
United Kingdom 2021-2023 None
Canada (Domestic)2018-2023 2019
Canada (International)2012-2023 2012-2019
Russia 2021-2023 None
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.
As of December 28, 2024, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was 2.3 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was 469 million as of December 28, 2024, of which 103 million of tax expense was recognized in 2024. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was 390 million as of December 30, 2023, of which 102 million of tax expense was recognized in 2023.

Carryforwards and Allowances
Operating loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling 34.0 billion as of December 28, 2024 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses and income tax credits from prior periods to reduce future taxable income or income tax liabilities. These operating losses and income tax credits will expire as follows 0.4 billion in 2025, 29.1
87
  
billion between 2026 and 2041 and 4.5 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 11 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest 11 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.
Note 6  Share-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.
As of December 28, 2024, 95 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized

Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation333644
As of December 28, 2024, there was 398 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no
88
  
longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.
Stock Options
A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows
2024 2023 2022
Expected life 7 years 7 years 7 years
Risk-free interest rate 4.2%4.2%1.9%
Expected volatility 16%16%16%
Expected dividend yield 2.9%2.7%2.5%
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period.PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCos performance against specified financial performance metrics.The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with
89
  
the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.
The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant.

Note 7  Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans
In 2024, we recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of 213 million (165 million after-tax or 0.12 per share) in a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan due to lump sum distributions to retired or terminated employees and the purchase of a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future benefit payments for certain retirees. The settlement charge was triggered when the aggregate of the cumulative lump sum distributions and the annuity contract premium exceeded the total annual service and interest cost.
Effective December 31, 2022, we merged two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), mostly inactive participants, and PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A, mostly active participants, with Plan I remaining. The accrued benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. The merger was made to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses of the merged plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this merger.
In 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of 145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further information.
In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025.
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H) (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 11 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 26 years).
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective December 31, 2025 is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.

The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.
The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components
Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.
Amortization of prior service cost(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.
Amortization of net loss(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
Settlementcurtailment loss(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.

We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. We also participate in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis, including both cash and non-cash collaterals.
For 2025 and 2024, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.5% and 7.4%, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows
2025 2024
Fixed income 56%55%
U.S. equity 22%22%
International equity 18%19%
Real estate 4%4%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure
96
  
that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.
Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2024 and 2023 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows

Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates
The assumed health care cost trend rates for both 2025 and 2024 are as follows
Average increase assumed 5%
Ultimate projected increase 4%
Year of ultimate projected increase 2046
Annually, we review external data and our historical experience to estimate assumed health care cost trend rates that impact our retiree medical plan obligation and expense, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.
Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.
Certain U.S. employees, who are either not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan or whose benefit is capped, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on either years of service or age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our total Company contributions were 411 million, 356 million and 283 million, respectively.

The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PepsiCo, Inc. on a senior unsecured basis and may be assumed at any time by PepsiCo, Inc. as the primary and sole obligor.
The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.
In 2024, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 24, 2029. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to 5.0 billion in U.S. dollars andor euros, including a 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to 5.75 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, up to two times during the term of the 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our 4.2 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 26, 2023.
Also in 2024, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 23, 2025. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to 5.0 billion in U.S. dollars andor euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to 5.75 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our 4.2 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 26, 2023.
Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 28, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.
In 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance 94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of 102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022.
In 2022, we paid 750 million to redeem all 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due May 2022, we paid 800 million to redeem all 800 million outstanding principal amount
99
  
of our 3.10% senior notes due July 2022 and we paid 154 million to redeem all 133 million outstanding principal amount of our subsidiary, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc.s 7.00% senior notes due March 2029 and 5.50% notes due May 2035.
Note 9  Financial Instruments
Derivatives and Hedging
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in
commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy
foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions and
interest rates.
In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and non-derivative debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instruments fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings for cash flow hedges and when the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated for net investment hedges. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings there were no such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 28, 2024.
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows associated with the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified within investing activities.
Credit Risk
We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moodys Investors Service, Inc.) or A (SP Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 28, 2024 was 208 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 28, 2024.
100
  
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than two years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, metals, and energy. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
Interest Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense. These instruments effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of our interest rate swap contracts match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and they have terms of no more than six years. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
As of December 28, 2024, approximately 13% of total debt was subject to variable rates, after the impact of the related interest rate swap contracts, compared to approximately 9% as of December 30, 2023.
Foreign Exchange
We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives including, but not limited to, forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. The forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts have terms of no more than two years and twelve years, respectively. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of our cross-currency interest rate swap contracts match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related foreign currency debt. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
Net Investment Hedges
We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in our foreign operations. We manage this risk for certain of our foreign operations by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges.
101
  
In 2024, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 500 million for Chinese renminbi and maturity dates ranging from November 2025 to November 2029. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign operations with Chinese renminbi functional currency.
We use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for our net investment hedges. Excluded components in the form of interest accruals on cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded in net interest expense and other.
The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 are as follows

Debt Securities
Held-to-Maturity
Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of commercial paper. As of December 28, 2024, we have no investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. As of December 30, 2023, we had 309 million investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 30, 2023, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.
Available-for-Sale
Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security.
In 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius) to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States and invested 550 million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after six years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years. Shares underlying the transaction were priced at 75 per share, and the
102
  
preferred shares are entitled to a 5% annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. Given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of this investment was classified as Level 2, based primarily on the transaction price. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investment in the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 30, 2023, we transferred 558 million from Level 2 to Level 3 as unobservable inputs to the fair value became more significant and subsequently recorded an unrealized gain of 612 million in other comprehensive income and a decrease in the investment of 14 million due to cash dividends received. In the year ended December 28, 2024, we recorded an unrealized loss of 350 million in other comprehensive income and a decrease in the investment of 21 million due to cash dividends received.
In addition, during the year ended December 28, 2024, we transferred 184 million of other available-for-sale debt securities from Level 2 to Level 3, as unobservable inputs to the fair value became more significant, and subsequently recorded an unrealized gain of 72 million in other comprehensive income.
There were no impairment charges related to our investments in available-for-sale debt securities in the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. There were net unrealized gains of 334 million and 612 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, associated with our available-for-sale debt securities.
TBG Investment
In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBGs earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). See Note 13 for further information.
In 2023, we recorded our proportionate share of TBGs earnings, which included an impairment of TBGs indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of 321 million (243 million after-tax or 0.18 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our PBNA division. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG, which we categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
In 2024, after identifying several indicators of impairment such as worsening operating losses and liquidity position, we quantitatively assessed our investment in TBG for impairment and, consequently, recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our remaining investment, resulting in pre-tax impairment charges of 498 million (416 million after-tax or 0.30 per share), with 409 million in our PBNA division and 89 million in our Europe division, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows. We also recorded an allowance for expected credit losses in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024, primarily related to outstanding receivables associated with the Juice Transaction see Note 1 for further information.

(a)Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.
(b)Classified as other assets. Includes Level 3 assets of 1,041 million as of December 28, 2024, and Level 2 assets of 178 million and Level 3 assets of 1,156 million as of December 30, 2023. The fair value of our Level 3 investment in Celsius is estimated using probability-weighted discounted future cash flows based on a Monte Carlo simulation using significant unobservable inputs such as an 80% probability that a certain market-based condition will be met and an average estimated discount rate of 7.3% and 8.1% as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on Celsius estimated synthetic credit rating. The fair value of the other Level 3 investment is estimated using a lattice model primarily based on the underlying stock price, volatility and certain significant unobservable inputs, such as a discount rate of 8.3% as of December 28, 2024, based upon an estimated synthetic credit rating. An increase in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or a decrease in the discount rate would result in a higher fair value measurement, while a decrease in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower fair value measurement. The fair value of our Level 2 investment as of December 30, 2023 approximates the transaction price and any accrued returns, as well as the amortized cost.
(c)Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.
(d)Based primarily on the price of our common stock.
(e)Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees investment elections.
(f)Based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate forward rates. As of December 28, 2024, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was 1.9 billion, which was classified on the balance sheet within long-term debt obligations.

Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was 40 billion and 41 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

Note 12  Leases
Lessee
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year.We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).

Note 13  Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisition of remaining ownership in Sabra
On December 3, 2024, we acquired the Strauss Groups 50% ownership in Sabra for total consideration of 241 million in cash, resulting in Sabra becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. Upon consolidation, we recognized a pre-tax gain of 122 million (92 million after-tax or 0.07 per share) in our FLNA division, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to the remeasurement of our previously held 50% equity ownership in Sabra at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, net of a control premium, and discounted cash flows.
We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in the fourth quarter of 2024. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our FLNA division. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this transaction as of the acquisition date primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of 0.3 billion and property, plant and equipment of 0.1 billion. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revision, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the fourth quarter of 2025.
Acquisition of Siete
On January 17, 2025, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interest in Siete, a Mexican-American foods business, in a transaction valued at approximately 1.2 billion. The total consideration transferred was approximately 1.2 billion in cash. The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the acquisition date.
We will account for the transaction as a business combination in the first quarter of 2025. We will recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Siete as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets, will be based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to the preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the first quarter of 2026.
Juice Transaction
In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately 3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBGs portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBGs earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).
As a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see detailed income statement activity below), including 520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39% ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo ws and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net working

capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement.

In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to TBG to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, TBG is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup.
The Juice Transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.
In the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we recognized i mpairment and other charges related to our TBG investment. See Notes 1 and 9 for further information.
Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include transaction expenses, such as consulting, advisory and other professional fees, and merger and integration charges. Merger and integration charges include employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs.

Note 14 Supply Chain Financing Arrangements
As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCos creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
A summary of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under the supplier finance program for the year ended December 28, 2024 is as follows

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
115
  
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 28, 2024, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of 2.3 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.
We identified the evaluation of certain of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authoritys settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years tax returns in light of new information.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authoritys settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority
116
  
settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Companys tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Companys interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2024.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our fourth quarter of 2024, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During 2024, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with our 2019 multi-year
120
  
productivity plan and resulting organization and business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan.
