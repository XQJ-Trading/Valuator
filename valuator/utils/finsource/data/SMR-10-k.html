Part I
Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to NuScale, the Company, we, us or our refer to the consolidated operations of NuScale Corp and NuScale LLC.
Overview
NuScale is redefining nuclear power through the development of proprietary and innovative SMR technology that will deliver safe, scalable, cost-effective and reliable carbon-free power. Our core technology, the NuScale Power Module (NPM), can generate 77 MWe and is premised on well-established nuclear technology principles, with a focus on the integration of components, simplification or elimination of systems and use of passive safety features. This results in a safe and highly reliable power plant suitable to be sited close to where electricity or process heat is needed.
Since 2007, over 1.8 billion has been invested in the development of our technology and we have received 478 patents globally, with an additional 194 patent applications currently pending. In September 2020, our 12-module design (currently approved for 160 million watts of thermal power or 50 MWe per NPM) became the first and only SMR to receive an SDA from the NRC. The NRCs final rulemaking approving NuScales design certification became effective in February 2023. The approval was a critical milestone that allows customers to move forward with plans to develop NuScale SMR-based power plants, knowing that safety aspects of the NuScale design are NRC-approved.
In January 2023, the Company submitted a second SDA Application and the associated licensing topical reports to the NRC for NuScales 6-module, 77 MWe NPM plant design. On July 31, 2023, the NRC formally announced that it accepted the Companys SDA Application for review. Once approved, customers in the United States will be able to reference the certified design and SDA for expedited construction and operating licensing of NuScales SMR pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. Based on the NRCs published schedule for SDA Application review, we expect the NRC will complete its review and SDA approval will be received by mid-year 2025.
Our unique SMR has several key defining characteristics, including
Proven.Our NPM technology leverages existing light water nuclear reactor technology and conventional low-enriched uranium fuel supply that have been operating globally for over 60 years.
Simple.NuScales simple NPM design, based on natural circulation, integrates the reactor core, steam generators and pressurizer in a single factory-built vessel and eliminates the need for reactor coolant circulating pumps, large bore piping and other components found in conventional large-scale nuclear reactors. This simplicity improves safety and reduces capital and operational costs.
Scalable. Our NPMs allow for scalability from one to twelve modules in a single installation, with typical scales of 12-module (924 MWe), six-module (462 MWe) and four-module (308 MWe) versions. These NuScale SMR-based configurations can commence operation with one module and scale to house up to their approved capacity of four, six or twelve modules.This scalability will allow customers to right-size their up-front capital investment and economically increase installed capacity over time through the addition of NPMs.
Safe. NuScales SMR technology has been designed to be the safest nuclear plants in the world and have several industry-first advantages over conventional large-scale nuclear plants, including anunlimitedcoping period during which the NPMs can be shut down and kept in a safe condition without operator intervention, AC or DC power or any additional cooling water. As a result, we have numerous operational and commercial advantages including a safety case that supports a small, site-boundary emergency planning zone (EPZ) designation by the NRC, as well as various resiliency and reliability features including the ability to start and operate a plant without AC or DC power to provide first-responder power.
In addition to the sale of NPMs, we will offer a diversified suite of services throughout the development and operating life of the power plant. Our suite of services is planned to include licensing support, testing, training, fuel supply services and program management, among others. We anticipate that our services offerings will have high penetration rates across our customer base and will provide consistent, recurring revenues throughout the project deployment phase and operating lives of NPMs. We expect service revenue to begin approximately five years prior to a power plants commercial operation date and to extend throughout the life of the power plant.
Our potential offtake customers are a mix of domestic and international governments, utilities, state-owned enterprises and technology and industrial companies in need of carbon-free, reliable energy.

To date, the DOE has granted NuScale four separate cost-share awards totaling more than 578.3 million, including most recently, a cost-share award granted in 2020 in which the DOE obligated 262.7 million through the 2024 fiscal year. We also benefit from a global network of strategic investors and supply chain partners that we expect will play an integral role in bringing NuScales technology to market around the world. Fluor, a leading global engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm, and NuScales largest stockholder, collaborates on plant design and the provision of EPC services to NuScales customers. Other strategic investors and supply chain partners include Doosan Enerbility Co., Ltd Sargent  Lundy, LLC Sarens Nuclear  Industrial Services, LLC JGC Holdings Corporation IHI Holdings Corporation GS Energy Corporation and Samsung CT Corporation, among others.
As discussed in the section titled Customers below, the Company currently is working on a project with Fluor in Romania. RoPower Nuclear S.A. (RoPower), which is a joint venture established by S.N. Nuclearelectrica S.A. (Nuclearelectrica) and Nova Power  Gas S.A. In the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, Nuclearelectrica and RoPower were authorized to proceed with Fluor on a Phase 2 Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) work. FEED Phase 2 will include tasks related to the development of a Class 3 plant cost estimate, as well as support to RoPower with its regulatory and stakeholder engagements. NuScale is supporting their scope of this FEED Phase 2 as a subcontractor to Fluor.
NuScale has aligned with ENTRA1 as its commercialization  developer partner for NuScale SMRs. ENTRA1 will develop and construct new build energy plants that will be designated  identified as ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMRs inside and are the ideal solutions addressing the challenges and meeting the objectives for the customer. The ENTRA1 Solution was developed to specifically address the key needs of nuclear energy deployment projects, lessons learned from past projects, and most importantly the real-world requirements, constraints and considerations of utilities, off-takers and stakeholders. The ENTRA1 Solution is a one-stop-shop integrated offering to deployment that proactively combines facility design and construction, development, financing, licensing, manufacturing and operations in a framework that delivers new dispatchable, carbon-free baseload generation capacity within acceptable cost, time and risk profiles for utilities, off-takers and stakeholders.
Merger Transaction
On December 13, 2021, Spring Valley, NuScale LLC and Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement. On May 2, 2022, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged into NuScale LLC (the Merger) with NuScale LLC surviving, Spring Valley was renamed NuScale Power Corporation, and NuScale LLC continued to be held as a wholly controlled subsidiary of NuScale Corp in an Up-C structure (collectively, the Transaction). As a result of the Transaction, NuScale Corp holds all of the NuScale LLC Class A units (which are the sole voting interests at the NuScale LLC level) and Legacy NuScale Equityholders hold NuScale LLC Class B units (which are non-voting) and shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock (which entitle the Legacy NuScale Equityholders to vote at the NuScale Corp level but which carry no economic rights). At specified times, in NuScale Corps discretion, Legacy NuScale Equityholders may exchange NuScale LLC Class B units (together with cancellation of an equal number of shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock) for NuScale Corp Class A common stock.
The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization as provided under GAAP, with NuScale Corp treated as the acquired company and NuScale LLC treated as the acquirer. This determination reflects that Legacy NuScale Equityholders hold a majority of the voting power of NuScale Corp, that NuScale LLCs pre-Merger operations constitute the majority post-merger operations of NuScale Corp, and that NuScale LLCs management team retained similar roles at NuScale Corp.
Industry
According to McKinsey  Companys Global Energy Perspective 2023 Power Outlook, global electricity demand is expected to more than double from 25,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) to between 52,000 and 71,000 TWh by 2050, due to the growth in demand from data centers, emerging markets energy needs and electrification across the economy.
With the projected growth in power demand, the retirement of older, non-flexible dispatchable capacity, and the growing share of intermittent renewables, there is expected to be a greater need for flexible assets on both the supply and demand sides to ensure security of supply.
The Role of Nuclear in the Energy Transition. According to BloombergNEFs New Energy Outlook 2024 (NEO 2024), nuclear capacity must triple to reach 1 terawatt by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. That will require the lifetime
2
of existing plants to be extended, accelerated deployment in mature and fledgling markets and rapid development of SMRs.
Social and Environmental Preferences.The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising temperature, and the resulting health and socio-economic stability of at-risk populations, have led to a societal focus on the environment. As a result, a global shift is occurring in societal preferences for a reduction in greenhouse gases and a move towards more carbon-free power.
Our Market Opportunity
According to the NEO 2024, a fully decarbonized global energy system by 2050 could come with a 215 trillion price tag. To progress towards reaching that goal on the supply side, for every dollar that goes to fossil fuels, an average of 3 needs to be invested in low-carbon energy over the remainder of the decade  up from parity today.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that the average 2023 capacity factor (the ratio of actual power output over generation capacity) for solar, wind and hydro was 23.2%, 33.2%, and 35.0%, respectively, compared to 93.0% for nuclear. In most regions globally, flexible and dispatchable sources, such as long-duration storage, geothermal, gas, coal with carbon capture and nuclear, will be essential. Among these sources, SMRs represent an attractive option based on their near-term viability, competitive costs, carbon-free emissions and reliability.
The production of nuclear energy as baseload power is imperative to maintaining carbon-free reliability in the U.S. electricity grid and is rightly viewed as a national security imperative. NuScale SMR Technology has the unique ability to provide the availability and reliability needed to secure our data for national security.
Strong leadership in the green economy is good for the environment and good for America and our allies. It supports our geopolitical interests by reducing reliance on non-domestic energy sources. In addition, it powers U.S. economic growth and enables global competitiveness. Additional nuclear energy supply will also support onshoring trends and Americas strong growth in domestic manufacturing.
In addition, new clean baseload generation provides highly reliable decarbonized energy at scale for large technology companies to help meet power needs for data centers and Artificial Intelligence (AI) while achieving sustainability objectives. ENTRA1s global pipeline for prospective data center and AI customers is expanding with significant inbound enquiries from tier one hyperscale computing providers. Other baseload generation includes the repurposing of coal-fired facilities to nuclear.
Market Opportunity and the Role of SMRs
SMRs are small nuclear reactors designed with scalable technology using module factory fabrication that pursue economies of series production and short construction times. The four primary technologies currently being pursued in SMRs are water-cooled reactors, fast neutron reactors, high temperature gas reactors and molten salt reactors. Light water reactors, such as our NPM, are considered by the World Nuclear Association to have the lowest technological risk and are the most developed from a commercial perspective benefiting from decades of proven technology.
SMRs have a number of inherent advantages over traditional large-scale nuclear and other carbon-free power generation, including
Simplicity of Design. Large scale nuclear plants, which typically generate 1 GW or more, are complex in terms of design and construction. SMRs are simpler to manufacture, construct, operate and maintain. SMRs are also designed to eliminate many of the nuclear components needed in large-scale plants which adds to their simplicity.
Enhanced Safety Features. Although our NPM is the only SMR with an NRC-approved safety case, according to the DOE, small modular reactors have the potential for enhanced safety and security compared to earlier designs. The smaller reactor core and reduced potential for off-site release from SMRs means SMRs may be located closer to population centers and industrial facilities in need of process heat. The robust design, small fuel inventory, and multiple barriers preventing fission product release contribute to a low probability and consequence of radionuclide release, even under extreme upset conditions, thus simplifying the emergency preparedness and response and providing a basis for reducing the EPZ. NuScale is the only company to obtain approval of its EPZ methodology from the NRC (or any other national government nuclear regulatory body) as well as the only SMR developer to have an approved regulatory basis for obtaining a site boundary EPZ. In 2022, the NRC approved a new methodology for SMR emergency planning however, no other SMR vendor has had its methodology approved following the new criteria.
3
Economics versus Traditional Nuclear. Traditional large-scale nuclear facilities have high upfront capital costs due to the size of the power plants as well as long construction times. These plants require significant resource planning and utilities have hesitated to deploy the capital necessary to build large-scale nuclear plants because of these high costs. SMRs are simpler, smaller and the reactors are largely factory built, leading to shorter construction times and greater cost predictability.
Modular and Scalable. SMRs can more easily match customer needs while avoiding surplus capacity. Modularity results in splitting power plant development between the factory and the field, reducing the schedule risk that has impacted large reactor construction projects. The NuScale modular design has the benefit to customers of being right-sizable upon construction and scalable over time.
Smaller Footprint. A typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear facility in the United States needs little more than one square mile to operate, while wind farms require 360 times more land area to produce the same amount of electricity and solar photovoltaic plants require 75 times more space. Furthermore, SMRs can be sited closer to the end-user, significantly reducing the need for transmission infrastructure while also providing ancillary benefits such as process heat to end users.
Our Technology
Our NPM is the product of approximately 18 years of research and development by NuScale and key collaborators, including Oregon State University and the Idaho National Laboratory. Over 1.8 billion (including non-dilutive DOE grants) has been invested to date to de-risk the technology, plant operations and manufacturing processes and obtain regulatory approvals. The technology is protected by 672 issued and pending patents globally.
NuScale SMR-based power plants are composed of multiple NPMs, each of which is capable of producing 77 MWe. The NPM consists of an integral reactor composed of the reactor core, helical coil steam generators and pressurizer within the reactor pressure vessel, enclosed in a steel containment vessel. The reactor core consists of an array of fuel assemblies and control rod clusters at standard enrichments. The helical coil steam generator consists of two independent sets of tube bundles with separate feedwater inlet and steam outlet lines. The integral reactor measures 65 feet tall and 9 feet in diameter. The containment vessel measures 76 feet tall and 15 feet in diameter and is much smaller and stronger than the concrete containment shells for large reactors. The NPM operates inside a stainless-steel lined, water-filled pool located below ground level.
NuScale Power ModuleTM
Our NPM technology leverages existing light water nuclear reactor technology and fuel that has been operating globally for over 60 years. The reactor operates using the principles of buoyancy-driven natural circulation hence, no pumps are needed to circulate water through the reactor. Once the heated water reaches the top of the riser, it turns downward into an annulus where the hot water flows over the steam generator tubes. Water in the reactor system is kept separate from the water inside the steam generator to prevent contamination. As the hot water in the reactor system passes over the hundreds
4
of tubes in the steam generator, heat is transferred through the tube walls and the water inside the tubes turns to superheated steam. This innovative design eliminates the need for reactor coolant pumps, large bore piping, complex safety systems and other components found in conventional large-scale nuclear reactors. The result is a simplified system that improves safety and reduces capital and operational costs.
Design Features and Innovations
Our NPM introduces a number of key design innovations that allows us to be the safest and most reliable provider of nuclear energy. These design features include
Proven Technology.Our NPM design relies on well-established pressurized, light water reactor technology. As such, NuScale SMR-based power plants can be licensed within the existing regulatory framework for light water reactors, drawing on a vast body of established research and development, proven codes and methods and existing regulatory standards. Because our technology was designed based on this proven foundation, we believe NuScale has a significant advantage over other alternative and yet unproven nuclear technologies that may come to market, both with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals and attracting customer interest.
Single, Integrated Unit.The NPM incorporates all of the components for steam generation and heat exchange into a single integrated unit. This design eliminates all large bore interconnection piping, which is historically a potential source of failure and cause of construction complexity for large-scale reactors.
Compact Size.Each NPM, including the containment vessel, can be entirely fabricated in a factory and shipped by rail, truck, or barge to the power plant site for assembly and installation. Fabrication of the modules in a factory environment reduces fabrication cost, improves quality, reduces construction time and increases schedule predictability. This is a distinct benefit compared to traditional large-scale nuclear plants in which reactors are built on-site and only after their completion can the balance of the plant be constructed. We can fabricate our NPMs in parallel with site construction, saving time and reducing complexity, labor and construction costs.
Natural Circulation.The reactor core of our NPM is cooled entirely by natural circulation of water. Natural circulation provides a significant advantage in that it reduces capital and operational costs by eliminating reactor coolant pumps, pipes and valves and the associated power, maintenance and potential failures of those components.
Refueling and Maintenance Innovations.Each NPM can produce power continuously for approximately 20 months before refueling is required. Because of the multi-module design of NuScale SMR-based power plants, each NPM can be refueled in a staggered manner, reducing total plant output by only 77 MWe for approximately 10 days. This significantly reduces the cost of replacement power compared to large-scale nuclear plants (typically 1,000 MWe) that must shut down their entire capacity for any outage. Whereas large-scale nuclear plants can require as many as 1,000 or more individuals for refueling and associated outage activities, we can undergo the same refueling and outage activities with a much smaller, permanent, in-house crew made up of as few as 50 individuals.
Multi-Module Control Room.NuScale has designed, and received NRC approval for, an innovative control room that can control up to 12 NPMs with only three licensed operators. This compares with traditional large-scale nuclear plants that require a minimum six licensed operators for three reactors. This innovation is enabled by NuScales proprietary platform called the Highly Integrated Protection System (HIPS). The HIPS platform provides a robust safety platform to monitor NPMs and help protectNuScale SMR-basedpower plants from potential cybersecurity attacks.
Safety Case
NuScales design innovations have allowed for several industry-first and best-in-class safety attributes.
Unlimited coping period.Our NPMs are designed with fully passive safety systems and are kept safe in a cooling condition for an unlimited time following any extreme event that renders a power plant without external power. During the span of such an event and for an unlimited time, NuScale SMR-based power plants do not require any internal or external human or computer actions, AC or DC power or additional water to cool the reactors (referred to as NuScales Triple Crown For Nuclear Plant Safety). An unlimited coping period is unprecedented for commercial light water nuclear reactors. Historically, commercial light water nuclear reactors have maximum coping periods of 72 hours before operator action is required to keep the reactor safe.
Support for Site Boundary EPZ.NuScale SMR-based power plants have been designed to allow an NRC-approved EPZ that does not extend beyond the power plant site boundary (the restricted area controlled by the plant owner). The NRC has approved NuScales methodology for calculating EPZ size. This methodology, approved solely for NuScales unique passively safe design, demonstrates that most NuScale SMR-based plant sites in the U.S. can be approved with a 300-yard site-boundary EPZ. Currently operating commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. are
5
required to have a 10-mile radius EPZ from the reactor site and the population within the EPZ must be capable of evacuating within a specified time period. The smaller EPZ enables NuScale SMR-based power plants to be sited closer to end-users, which is of particular importance to process heat off-takers and to owners seeking to repower retiring coal-fired generation facilities.
No Requirement for Backup Power.The NRC concluded that NuScales safety design eliminates the need for Class 1E power  i.e., safety-related, backup power. This means that NuScale SMR-based power plants do not need costly emergency diesel generators to ensure the safety of the reactors in the event of a power loss. Today, no operating nuclear plant in the United States can make this claim.
Resilience to Man-made and Natural Events.The NuScale SMR-based reactor building is designed to withstand the impact from man-made and natural events, including floods, earthquakes (in excess of the Fukushima event), tornados and hurricanes in excess of 280 mph winds, and the impact of a large commercial airplane. The NuScale SMR-based power plant is also designed to safely shut down following an electromagnetic pulse or geomagnetic disturbance.
Technology-Enabled Operational Features
NuScales design innovations and best-in-class safety case create several technology-enabled operational features that no other carbon-free generation source can claim. These features address a host of critical industry needs with respect to grid resiliency and reliability and provide customers with related commercial benefits that other power generation solutions do not provide. Select features of the NuScale SMR-based power plants include
No Requirement for connection to the grid. The NuScale SMR-based plant is the only commercial nuclear power plant approved by the NRC without requiring any connections to the transmission grid for safety. This allows off-grid operation such that NuScale SMR-based plants can be sited in the proximity of industries needing electricity and process heat. It also enables a NuScale SMR-based plant to replace a coal fired power station located at the end of a single transmission line.
First Responder Power.When the transmission grid is lost, traditional large-scale nuclear power plants automatically and rapidly shutdown. Large-scale nuclear power plants are not capable of restarting, nor are they permitted to do so, until the transmission grid is restored because power from the grid (supplied by two off-site sources) is required to power the safety systems and operate the equipment necessary to start the power plant. The NuScale SMR-based power plant would remain at power, ready to immediately sell electricity to the grid when the grid is back online, making it a first responder to the restoration of the transmission grid.
Black-Start Capability. A NuScale SMR-based power plant can start up from cold conditions without external grid connections. This NuScale design capability is a first-of-a-kind for the nuclear industry.
Island Mode Power. A single NPM can supply all the house load electricity needs of the plant while also continuing to provide power to a local industrial customer or mission critical facility without external grid connection via a micro-grid connection.
Highly Reliable Power. The 12-module power plants, that produce 924 MWe of power, will be able to provide 154 MWe to mission critical facilities such as data centers with 99.95% availability over the 60-year life of the plant. In the event of a catastrophic loss of offsite grid and disruption of transportation infrastructure, a 12-module power plant will be able to provide up to 120 MWe to a mission critical facility micro-grid for at least four years without refueling.

Design Validation, Testing and Manufacturing Trials
NuScale Control Room Simulator
NuScales safety design has been validated through rigorous testing of critical components, such as fuel assemblies, control rod and control rod drive mechanisms and the integral helical coil steam generators. NuScale has constructed an electrically-heated, one-third scale, high-pressure and temperature integral thermal-hydraulic test facility that demonstrates the operation of the entire nuclear steam supply system and safety systems. NuScale testing programs have been audited by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Long-lead items for the first six NPM upper reactor vessels, including forgings, tubing, tube bending machines, and weld materials have been received at the manufacturing site at Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Company, Ltd., the Companys manufacturing partner. Manufacturing trials for key components such as steam generator tubes and vessel cladding processes have been completed.

In addition, we have proven the ability to safely operate 12 NPMs from a single control room by building and operating a full-scale simulated control room. Through comprehensive testing in this simulator, NuScale has shown that the demands on the reactor operators are significantly reduced compared with traditional large reactors, as a result of the simplicity of the design, advancements in digital controls, and the fact that NuScales design requires no operator-initiated safety functions for all design basis events. Through comprehensive analyses, demonstrations and audits, the NRC has approved NuScales conduct of operation such that three licensed operators can safely operate a 12-module plant without the need for a Shift Technical Advisor, a key safety-related role required by the NRC for all existing large-scale nuclear plants.
Products and Services
NuScale has determined that it currently operates in a single segment and will periodically reassess that determination as it nears commercialization and deployment of its NPMs.
NuScale Power Modules and NSSS Equipment
Our core technology, the NuScale Power Module (NPM), can generate 77 MWe and is premised on well-established nuclear technology principles, with a focus on the integration of components, simplification or elimination of systems, and use of passive safety features.
A customer seeking to deploy a NuScale SMR-based power plant will be granted a license from NuScale to construct, operate, maintain and decommission the plant. NuScale will also provide design and nuclear regulatory licensing basis information necessary for the customer to obtain regulatory approval to construct and operate the power plant.
8
Sale of Equipment including NuScale Power Modules.NuScale expects to sell to the customer major nuclear-engineered equipment. This will consist of the NPMs, the reactor building crane, nuclear fuel, module assembly and handling equipment and other equipment associated with the nuclear steam supply system and nuclear fuel handling and storage. NuScale expects to provide the manufacturing and delivery of modules to the customers power plant site on a contracted basis. NuScale also expects to receive payment related to the fabrication of the NPMs coincident with the order of materials and commencement of manufacturing so that no working capital will be required from NuScale for work-in-progress or finished inventory.
Services
We will also offer customers a diversified suite of services throughout the life of the power plant, beginning approximately five years prior to a plants commercial operation date. Pre- and post-commercial operation date service offerings provide customers with critical services related to the licensing, design, development, construction, operation and maintenance of the power plant. As a first mover and developer of the power plants nuclear technology, we believe we are well positioned to be a trusted service provider. As such, we anticipate our services will have high penetration rates and will provide consistent, recurring revenues that could become significant once a large number of NuScale SMR-based plants are in operation.

Competitive Strengths
Only Viable Carbon-free Baseload Power.Nuclear is the only viable carbon-free baseload power available to address the global need for carbon-free generation and to meet decarbonization targets year-round. NuScale SMR-based power plants provide highly reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free baseload power to electric grids  no other existing baseload technology can claim the same benefits on the scale needed to address the worlds growing needs.
Innovative Technology Platform and Intellectual Property Portfolio.We have 478 patents issued and an additional 194 patents pending. These 672 patents protect key aspects of our technology, and we continue to grow our intellectual property portfolio. In addition, we have a highly educated workforce of 330 employees, of whom 79 have masters degrees in engineering and science and 21 have Ph.Ds. We believe our intellectual property rights, as well as our highly skilled personnel are important assets necessary to maintain our competitive advantage in the market and expand on our technology platform.
First to Receive an SDA from the NRC.Although China and Russia have currently operating SMRs, ours is the first and only SMR to receive an SDA from the NRC. This is an important regulatory milestone that provides customers with certainty  knowing that the NRC approves of the plant design  before committing significant capital to develop a nuclear facility. The SDA process took NuScale 41 months to complete  including preparation, application and receipt of approval. This was the fastest any nuclear reactor company has ever received approval from the NRC. To date, no SMR or advanced reactor company other than NuScale has even applied to the NRC for SMR SDA. We believe that this, and the fact that our design approval timeline was based on well-established light water nuclear technology, provides NuScale with a solid competitive advantage over other SMR competitors.
Unparalleled Safety Case.NuScales innovative, fully passive safety system design addresses the historical concerns of traditional large-scale nuclear power plants. In the event of a total loss of power to the facility, a NuScale SMR-based power plant does not require any operator or computer actions, grid connection or emergency backup power or additional water to cool the reactors and can remain safe indefinitely. All large-scale nuclear reactors require one or all three of these within a period of days. The rigorously tested safety case results in an array of applications and commercial opportunities
9
for NuScale that traditional nuclear power plants cannot support, and can be located closer to end-users and population centers.
Global Network of Strategic Investors and Supply Chain Partners with DOE Support.We have developed a global network of blue-chip supply chain partners, many of which are investors in NuScale. We believe these partners will play a critical role in the successful procurement of components and fuel supply, fabrication of components and manufacturing of our NPMs. In addition, we have also received significant financial and regulatory support from the DOE since the inception of NuScale.
Cost-Competitive.NuScales technology is cost-competitive both in the United States and globally. Our technologys reliability, resiliency and flexibility are key attributes that customers and regulators value highly. We believe our competitive cost coupled with our differentiated capabilities gives us a significant competitive advantage over other technologies.
Visionary Management Team.We have an experienced and passionate team of leaders and innovators who have developed the technology over the years and run the operations of the business today with extensive commercial and energy industry experience. Our executives have extensive prior management experience in nuclear and engineering organizations, such as the NRC, United States Navy, DOE, General Electric Company, Exelon Corporation, Framatome and others. Among key members of NuScales executive leadership team is Dr. Jos N. Reyes, Ph.D., co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of the Company. Dr. Reyes is co-designer of the NuScale SMR and is an internationally recognized expert on passive safety system design, testing and operations for nuclear power plants. Dr. Reyes has served as a technical expert at the International Atomic Energy Agency and as an engineer with the Reactor Safety Division of the NRC. He is Professor Emeritus in the School of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Oregon State University, was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2018 and holds over 182 patents granted or pending in 21 countries.
Competition
Our competitors are other power generation technologies, including traditional baseload, renewables, long duration storage and other nuclear reactors, including SMRs. We believe our competitive strengths differentiate us from our competition globally, in part because NuScales SMR technology is currently the only NRC-approved SMR technology capable of meeting the growing demand for carbon-free baseload generation.
Carbon-Free Energy. According to BloombergNEF, more than 40% of the worlds electricity came from zero-carbon sources in 2023, including wind, solar, hydroelectric and large-scale nuclear. Among these technologies, only nuclear is highly reliable, cost-effective, dispatchable and land use efficient. Additionally, since renewables are weather-dependent, they are too unreliable to support certain end-use cases, including mission-critical applications or industrial applications that require extensive on-site, always-available power. Due to their innovative design, NuScale SMR-based power plants can operate as baseload generation, load-follow renewables andor support key industrial applications.
Fossil Fuels. The majority of the worlds electricity continues to be sourced from gas, coal and oil. While reliable, these sources are carbon-intensive and we expect them to largely be replaced with carbon-free generation over time.
Other Advanced Nuclear Reactors.There are several reactor technologies that are in various stages of development, such as high temperature gas-cooled reactors, fast reactors, molten salt reactors, fusion technologies and others, and commercial SMRs are currently operating in China and Russia. These technologies, like ours, are designed to be clean, safe and highly reliable. However, these technologies have not received regulatory approval in the United States, and many of the technologies have not been demonstrated and do not have fuel supply infrastructure in place. Currently, we have the only SMR that has received an SDA from the NRC, and no other SMR company or customer has even applied for an SDA. Achieving SDA is a regulatory process that took us over 500 million to prepare and 41 months and over 200 million to complete.
Customers
NuScale, with its global strategic partner ENTRA1, has a strong pipeline of potential customers consisting of governments, political subdivisions, state-owned enterprises, investor-owned utilities and other technology and industrial companies, both in domestic and international markets, considering the deployment of an ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMRs inside. Our end-markets can be broken down into two general subsets baseload generation and industrial applications.
10
Many industrial customers require significant energy needs such as chemical plants, direct air capture facilities, hydrogen production facilities, oil refineries, metal smelters and water desalination plants. Our technology can provide the necessary reliable electricity and heat energy to these facilities in an environmentally efficient manner.
In December 2022, we completed our Standard Plant Design (SPD), which provides potential customers with a generic NuScale SMR-based power plant design that will serve as a starting point for deploying site-specific designs, including supporting client licensing and deployment activities. Further, international customers seeking to decarbonize and meet climate change goals are increasingly looking at NuScale SMR-based power plants as their means to meet energy needs and carbon-reduction goals.
RoPowerSNN. On November 4, 2021, NuScale and Nuclearelectrica, a national energy company in Romania that produces electricity, heat and nuclear fuel, signed a teaming agreement to advance the delivery of NuScales SMR technology. NuScale and RoPower, which is owned in equal shares by Nuclearelectrica and Nova Power  Gas S.A., announced on January 4, 2023, that a contract for pre-FEED work was signed between the parties on December 28, 2022. After completing the pre-FEED work, in July 2024, NuScale and RoPower signed a technology licensing agreement, which grants RoPower a right to use certain intellectual property of NuScales. This was followed up by the execution of a contract between NuScale and Fluor in October 2024 for work to be performed under Fluors FEED Phase 2 contract with RoPower, marking a significant step toward the near-term deployment of a RoPower Power Plant at the Doichest site in Romania expected to occur by 2030.
Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our business by leveraging our competitive advantages in scalability, safety, reliability and cost. We have a number of avenues to achieve our growth objectives
Traditional and New Applications.We believe the market for NuScale SMR-based power plants is wherever non-intermittent, reliable, carbon-free power is needed. Initially, we are focused on replacing carbon intensive coal-fired power plants and as an alternative to new-build gas-fired generation. Additionally, we are focused on our ENTRA1 partnership positioning their ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMRs inside to hyperscalers, technology, industrial and micro-grid customers in sectors that include direct air capture, water desalinization, hydrogen production and mission critical facilities.

Nuclear Safety Regulation
The commercial nuclear industry is heavily regulated in all countries, and regulatory approval is required for the design, construction and operation of every nuclear plant. Generally, nuclear safety regulators consider (1) design safety and robustness against internal hazards (e.g., component failures and fires) and external hazards (e.g., earthquakes and weather loads such as snow, rain and wind), and (2) environmental impacts of construction and operations (e.g., water use and preservation of historical sites and animal and plant species). Regulation must be addressed on a country-by-country basis, although regulators often collaborate when a design is deployed in multiple countries.
Our licensing strategy has two goals (1) obtain approval in the shortest possible time by engaging the regulator early and developing high quality applications and (2) maintain a common design of the NPM in as many markets as possible by leveraging the highly regarded NRC SDA during each regulatory approval process.
Nuclear Safety Regulatory Approval in the United States
We submitted a Design Certification Application (DCA) in December 2016 to the NRC, comprising 12,000 pages, with approximately 2,000,000 pages of additional documentation and 100 gigabytes of test data. Development of the DCA required approximately 500 million in testing and engineering. Approval by the NRC included over 250,000 review hours at a cost of approximately 70 million. In addition to paying the NRC review fees, we incurred approximately 130 million in costs responding to numerous NRC requests for additional information, analyses and audits. Despite the intensity of the review, the NRC approved the NuScale design in 42 monthsthe fastest approval ever completed by the agency. We received the SDA for our 50 MWe NPM and 12-module plant design in August 2020, and our SMR design is currently the only SMR with such an approval. The NRC subsequently certified the design as Appendix G to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 52. No other SMR or non-light water nuclear vendor has applied to the NRC for a nuclear power reactor SDA.
In January 2023, the Company submitted a second SDA Application and the associated licensing topical reports to the NRC for NuScales 6-module, 77 MWe NPM plant design. On July 31, 2023, the NRC formally announced that it accepted the Companys SDA Application for review. Once approved, customers in the United States will be able to reference the certified design and SDA for expedited construction and operating licensing of NuScales SMR pursuant to 10 CFR Part
16
52. Based on the NRCs published schedule for SDA Application review, we expect the NRC will complete its review and SDA approval will be received by mid-year 2025.
Customers that use our design will be able to incorporate an SDA into their license applications. The license application review can begin before the SDA application is approved. The NRC does not re-review the design in the SDA during the license application review the review is limited to site specific design features (e.g., physical security systems, water intake structures), operational programs (e.g., maintenance, emergency preparedness) and environmental impacts. The ability to incorporate an SDA and provide only site-specific information to file a license application is an improved licensing process developed by the NRC and industry and has been used by all new reactor designs and license applications since the early 1990s. This process, known as Part 52, substantially reduced regulatory and financial risk for license applicants compared to the older process, known as Part 50. As the only SMR vendor using Part 52 to date, NuScale has a competitive advantage and that makes our SMR attractive to potential customers.
Nuclear Safety Regulatory Approval Internationally
Generally speaking, most countries limit license applications to the proposed owner andor operator of nuclear power plants. Where appropriate in support of a customer or at the request of the regulator, we intend to engage early with regulators in each country of interest, consistent with our approach in the U.S.
The NRC has bilateral relationships with many other countries and participates in several international support organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Nuclear Regulators Association. We expect NRC approval will benefit our ability to obtain regulatory approvals internationally and will give foreign regulators confidence that the NuScale design is safe. We also expect to benefit from the NRCs regulatory assistance program, through which the NRC collaborates with other countries regulators to understand the basis for the NRC approval of our design.
NuScale is also engaging directly with the IAEA to facilitate regulatory approval abroad. The IAEA, while not a regulator, is important because many countries regulatory frameworks were developed from IAEA standards, which are somewhat different from the NRC framework. NuScale completed the Technical Safety Review of Design Safety (TSR-D5) with the IAEA in December of 2024. The purpose of a TSR-DS is to review the design safety of a nuclear power plant against the IAEA safety standards. The TSR-DS evaluated the NuScale-based 6 plant design information along with three supplemental reports against the IAEA safety requirements. The purpose of the review was to identify strengths and potential weaknesses of the safety case to expedite licensing in countries that employ IAEA safety guidelines.
In addition, we have had significant interaction with safety regulators and energy ministries in many of the countries where there is significant customer interest. For example we have worked through material parts of the Vendor Design Review process with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission we have completed a technology assessment conducted by the Office of Nuclear Regulation in the U.K. we completed a licensing gap analysis (comparing select local, IAEA and Western European Nuclear Regulators Association requirements against the NuScale design) with the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate in Ukraine and we have performed analysis of NuScale SMR-based plant safety, economy and maneuverability under a study funded by Japans Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
Other Regulation
In addition to nuclear safety regulation, NuScale is subject to other nuclear regulatory controls such as export control, nuclear material safeguards and non-proliferation restrictions and liability insurance regimes (e.g., Price-Andersen Act, the 1960 Paris Convention, the 1963 Vienna Convention, and the 1997 Convention on Supplementary Compensation). NuScale plans to sell its plants only in jurisdictions where nuclear liability is exclusively channeled to the plant operator.
Customers purchasing NuScale SMR-based plants also must obtain required permits, licenses and insurance for the jurisdiction where the facility will be located. In the United States, a NuScale SMR-based plant developer must obtain an NRC construction permit and an NRC operating license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 or a combined license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. Other U.S. federal permits or licenses for a NuScale SMR-based plant may include a Section 404 Dredge  Fill Permit issued by the Army Corp. of Engineers a Federal Aviation Administration  77.15 Permit a Certificate of Registration issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation and a Spills Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. State or local regulators may also require permits or licenses for a NuScale SMR-based plant, including a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit for Storm Water Discharges from Construction Activities and to Construct a Sanitary Wastewater,
17
Wastewater Treatment facility Section 401 Water Quality Certification Well Permits Solid Waste Handling Permit and appropriate building permits.
Export Controls
NuScales business is subject to, and complies with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) from the Bureau of Industry and Security which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and regulations issued by the DOE. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and to further its nonproliferation policies. Nuclear technology, also known as technical data, is controlled by 10 CFR Part 810, under the regulations of the DOE. Nuclear hardware and codes specifically designed or modified for use in a nuclear reactor are controlled by the NRC under 10 CFR Part 110.
The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the EAR and other export control regulations have a degree of discretion interpreting and enforcing these regulations. These agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying or instituting specific conditions regarding authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. governments commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a group of nuclear supplier countries that seek to prevent nuclear proliferation by controlling the export of materials, equipment and technology that can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control regulations. For example, 10 CFR Part 810, Appendix A provides a list of countries that are considered Generally Authorized, meaning they are considered to be non-sensitive. Countries not on this list are required to be specifically authorized prior to sharing any nuclear technology. Under Part 110, the NRC regulates the export or import of nuclear hardware, material and code, following similar protocols with respect to the same sensitive countries versus non sensitive countries regulatory structure embedded in 10 CFR Part 810.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
We have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the financial statements and related notes contained in this report.
Risks Related to Our Structure and Governance
NuScale Corp is a holding company and its only material asset is its interest in NuScale LLC, and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions made by its subsidiaries to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay dividends and fees associated with being a public company such as director retainers, NYSE and other regulatory filings.
NuScale Corp is a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of NuScale LLC units. As a result, NuScale Corp has no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. NuScale Corps ability to pay taxes, cause NuScale LLC to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay dividends depends on the financial results and cash flows of NuScale LLC and the distributions it receives (directly or indirectly) from NuScale LLC. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of NuScale LLC for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that NuScale Corp needs funds and NuScale LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or NuScale LLC is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect NuScale Corps liquidity and financial condition.
NuScale LLC is treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally will not be subject to any entity-level United States federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of NuScale LLC units. Accordingly, NuScale Corp will be required to pay income taxes on its allocable share of any net taxable income from NuScale LLC. Under the terms of the Sixth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of NuScale LLC (the AR NuScale LLC Agreement), NuScale LLC is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of NuScale LLC units calculated at certain assumed tax rates. In addition to income taxes, NuScale Corp is also expected to incur expenses related to its operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant, and some of which will be reimbursed by NuScale LLC (excluding payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement). NuScale Corp intends to cause NuScale LLC to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to holders of NuScale LLC units on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes, relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by NuScale Corp. However, as discussed above, NuScale LLCs ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of NuScale LLC and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained in NuScale LLCs debt agreements, if any, or any applicable law or that would have the effect of rendering NuScale LLC insolvent. To the extent that NuScale Corp is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial.
Additionally, although NuScale LLC generally will not be subject to any entity-level United States federal income tax, it may be liable under recent United States federal tax legislation for adjustments to prior year tax returns, absent an election to the contrary. In the event NuScale LLCs calculations of taxable income are incorrect, NuScale LLC and its members, including NuScale Corp, in later years may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this legislation and its related guidance.
If NuScale LLC were treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax or state tax purposes, then the amount available for distribution by NuScale LLC could be substantially reduced and the value of NuScale Corp shares could be adversely affected.
An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes (such as NuScale LLC) may nonetheless be treated as, and taxable as, a corporation if it is a publicly traded partnership unless an exception to such treatment applies. An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for United States federal
19
income tax purposes will be treated as a publicly traded partnership if interests in such entity are traded on an established securities market or interests in such entity are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. If NuScale LLC were determined to be treated as a publicly traded partnership (and taxable as a corporation) for United States federal income tax purposes, it would be taxable on its income at the United States federal income tax rates applicable to corporations and distributions by NuScale LLC to its partners (including NuScale Corp) could be taxable as dividends to such partners to the extent of the earnings and profits of NuScale LLC. In addition, NuScale Corp would no longer have the benefit of increases in the tax basis of NuScale LLCs assets as a result of exchanges of NuScale LLC Class B units. Pursuant to the AR NuScale LLC Agreement, certain Legacy NuScale Equityholders may, from time to time, subject to the terms of the AR NuScale LLC Agreement, exchange their interests in NuScale LLC and have such interests redeemed by NuScale LLC for cash or shares of Class A common stock. While such exchanges could be treated as trading in the interests of NuScale LLC for purposes of testing publicly traded partnership status, the AR NuScale LLC Agreement contains restrictions on redemptions and exchanges of interests in NuScale LLC that are intended to prevent NuScale LLC entities from being treated as a publicly traded partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Such restrictions are designed to comply with certain safe harbors provided for under applicable United States federal income tax law. NuScale Corp may also impose additional restrictions on exchanges that it determines to be necessary or advisable so that NuScale LLC is not treated as a publicly traded partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, while such position is not free from doubt, NuScale LLC is expected to be operated such that it is not treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes and we intend to take the position that NuScale LLC is so treated as a result of exchanges of its interests (i.e., LLC Class B common units exchanged for Class A common shares) pursuant to the AR NuScale LLC Agreement. If NuScale LLC were treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, it could have a material adverse impact on NuScale Corps liquidity and financial condition as a result of the additional corporate tax payable at the NuScale LLC level.
Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, NuScale Corp will be required to pay to certain Legacy NuScale Equityholders 85% of certain tax benefits, if any, that it realizes (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of any increases in tax basis and related tax benefits resulting from any exchange of NuScale LLC Class B units for shares of Class A common stock or cash in the future, and those payments may be substantial.
The Legacy NuScale Equityholders may in the future exchange their NuScale LLC Class B units for shares of Class A common stock (or, upon the election of NuScale Corp, cash in an amount equal to the net proceeds raised by selling such shares of Class A common stock in a contemporaneous underwritten offering), subject to certain restrictions. Such transactions are expected to result in increases in NuScale Corps share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of NuScale LLC. These increases in tax basis may result in increased tax depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income tax that NuScale Corp would otherwise be required to pay in the future had such sales and exchanges never occurred.
NuScale Corp is party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with NuScale LLC, each of the TRA Holders (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) party thereto and Fluor, in its capacity as TRA Representative (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement). Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, NuScale Corp will be required to pay 85% of the net cash tax savings from certain tax benefits, if any, that it realizes (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of any increases in tax basis and other tax benefits resulting from any exchange by the TRA Holders of NuScale LLC Class B units for shares of Class A common stock or cash in the future. Any such payments to TRA Holders will reduce the cash provided by the tax savings generated from future exchanges that would otherwise have been available to NuScale Corp for other uses, including reinvestment or dividends to Class A stockholders. Cash tax savings from the remaining 15% of the tax benefits will be retained by NuScale Corp. NuScale Corps obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement accelerate upon a change in control and certain other termination events, as defined therein. These payments are the obligation of NuScale Corp and not of NuScale LLC. The actual increase in NuScale Corps allocable share of NuScale LLCs tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the shares of Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of the recognition of NuScale Corps income. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that NuScale Corp will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement are outside of its control, NuScale Corp expects that the payments it will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on NuScale Corps financial condition. Any payments made by NuScale Corp under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to NuScale Corp. To the extent that NuScale Corp is unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid however, nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a
20
material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Furthermore, NuScale Corps future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make it a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may exceed the actual tax benefits NuScale Corp realizes.
Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that NuScale Corp determines, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of the tax basis increases, as well as other tax positions that NuScale Corp takes, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by NuScale Corp are disallowed, the Legacy NuScale Equityholders will not be required to reimburse NuScale Corp for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to such holders will be netted against any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by NuScale Corp under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if any, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by NuScale Corp may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that NuScale Corp might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments against which to net. As a result, in certain circumstances NuScale Corp could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of NuScale Corps actual income tax savings, which could materially impair NuScale Corps financial condition.
Moreover, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in certain events, including a change of control, breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or NuScale Corp exercise of early termination rights, NuScale Corp obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will accelerate and NuScale Corp will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to the Legacy NuScale Equityholders party to the Tax Receivable Agreement equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to NuScale Corp future taxable income. The lump-sum payment could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that NuScale Corp realizes subsequent to such payment because such payment would be calculated assuming, among other things, that NuScale Corp would have certain tax benefits available to it and that NuScale Corp would be able to use the potential tax benefits in future years.
There may be a material negative effect on NuScale Corps liquidity if the payments required to be made by NuScale Corp under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that NuScale Corp realizes. Furthermore, NuScale Corps obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control.
Risks Related to NuScales Business and Industry
Commercialization Risk Factors
We have not yet commercialized or sold NPMs, and a number of factors could prevent, delay or hinder commercialization.
We have not yet entered into a binding contract with a customer to deliver NPMs, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.
The planned initial deployment of our NPM is subject to NuScale reaching a binding agreement for its scope of supply with RoPower Nuclear S.A. (RoPower) and NuScale reaching a binding engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Fluor. If NuScale does not enter into binding agreements with RoPower or Fluor, initial deployment of our NPM, power plants, and ongoing services could be significantly delayed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Memoranda of understanding we have entered into with other potential customers are contingent and may not result in binding agreements for the purchase of our products or services. Discussions are under way with other potential NuScale customers, but NuScale has yet to secure an NPM order from them.
Competitors in China and Russia currently operate commercial SMRs and may have advantages in marketing their SMRs to potential customers.
21
Competitors in Russia and China, such as Rosatom and China National Nuclear Corporation, currently operate commercial SMRs in those countries. Although their SMR designs have not been approved by the NRC or in any jurisdiction outside of their native countries, those competitors may have a competitive advantage if they are able to obtain approval comparable to the NRCs SDA, or if they can otherwise demonstrate to potential customers the value and benefits of their SMRs, particularly in jurisdictions that have less stringent regulatory requirements. In addition, these competitors may have access to greater government or other funding to develop and commercialize their SMRs than we do.
Any delays in the development and manufacture of NPMs and related technology may adversely impact our business and financial condition.
We have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, production and delivery of NPMs and related technology that could prevent us from delivering NPMs in 2028 or beyond. If delays like this recur, if our remediation measures and process changes are not successful, if we fail to find a satisfactory manufacturer or if we experience issues with planned manufacturing activities or design and safety, we could experience issues or delays in sustaining or further increasing production and sales of NPMs.
If we encounter difficulties in scaling our production and delivery capabilities, if we fail to develop and successfully commercialize our NPMs and related technologies, if we fail to develop such technologies before our competitors or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those of our competitors or are perceived as less safe than those of our competitors, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.
We have not yet delivered NPMs to customers, and any setbacks we may experience during our first commercial delivery and other demonstration and commercial missions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, and could harm our reputation.
The success of our business will depend on our ability to successfully deliver NPMs to customers on-time and on-budget at guaranteed performance levels, which would tend to establish greater confidence in our subsequent customers. This means manufacturing all components to specification (satisfying quality inspection criteria) and delivering those components to the RoPower site on schedule and without delay or incident. There is no guarantee that our planned NPM deployments will be successful. There can be no assurance that we will not experience operational or process failures and other problems during our first commercial deployment or any planned deployment thereafter. Any failures or setbacks, particularly on our first commercial deployments, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Any actual or perceived safety or reliability issues may result in significant reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to legal liability and other costs that may arise. Such issues could result in delaying or cancelling planned deployments of NPMs, increased regulation, or other adverse systemic consequences. Our inability to meet our safety standards or adverse publicity affecting our reputation as a result of accidents or mechanical failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
We have incurred significant losses since inception, we expect to incur losses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
We have incurred significant losses since our inception well beyond the support we have received through cost-sharing awards from the DOE. We have not yet delivered NPMs to customers and none of our flagship plants, have been permitted or are under construction, and it is difficult for us to predict our future operating results. As a result, our losses may be larger than anticipated, and we may not achieve profitability when expected or at all even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.
We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we commence deployment of NPMs, continue to refine and streamline our design and manufacturing processes for our NPMs, make technical improvements, hire additional employees and continue research and development efforts relating to new products and technologies. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue, profits or growth in our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow. Furthermore, if our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if we have future negative cash flow or losses resulting from our investment in acquiring customers or expanding our operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
22
The cost of electricity generated from nuclear sources or our NPMs may not be cost competitive with future electricity generation sources in some markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
Some electricity markets experience very low power prices due to a combination of subsidized renewables and low-cost fuel sources, and NuScale may not be able to compete in these markets unless the benefits of the carbon-free, reliable andor resilient energy generation provided by our NPMs are sufficiently valued in the market. Given the relatively lower electricity prices in the United States when compared to many international markets, the risk may be greater with respect to business in the United States. Inflation may also increase the cost of our NPMs to a point where the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) generated from a NuScale SMR-based plant is not competitive with the alternatives.
Loss of government incentives to use nuclear power may have an adverse impact on the market for SMRs.
In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides production tax credits for advanced reactors and small modular reactors. The United States may decide to reduce or eliminate these economic incentives or curtail legislative programs supportive of nuclear energy technologies for political, financial or other reasons. Any reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies, economic incentives or favorable legislative programs could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.
The market for SMRs generating nuclear power is not yet established and may not achieve the growth potential we expect or may grow more slowly than expected.
The market for SMRs has not yet been established. Our estimates for the total addressable market are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including our potential contracted revenue, the number of potential customers who have expressed interest in our NPMs, assumed prices and production costs for our NPMs, our ability to leverage our current logistical and operational processes, and general market conditions. However, our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our services, as well as the expected growth rate for the total addressable market for our services, may prove to be incorrect.
Our commercialization strategy relies heavily on our relationship with ENTRA1, Fluor and other strategic investors and partners, who may have interests that diverge from ours and who may not be easily replaced if our relationships terminate.
We rely heavily upon our relationship with Fluor, the largest stockholder in NuScale, and our relationships with other of our investors and strategic partners, including ENTRA1, to commercialize our NPM and our other products and services. We granted Fluor certain rights to provide engineering, procurement and construction services in connection with NuScales general plant design, project-specific designs and services typically performed by Fluor or its direct competitors. Similarly, we have entered into certain agreements with Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Company, Ltd., IHI Corporation, and Sarens Nuclear  Industrial Services, LLC for certain planning, engineering, manufacturing and support activities, and JGC Holdings Corporation, an affiliate of Japan NuScale Innovation, LLC, related to the EPC and commissioning of the first NuScale SMR-based plant, with Samsung CT Corporation related to certain EPC activities and with GS Energy with respect to project development in certain markets. We have aligned with ENTRA1 as our commercialization  developer partner for NuScale SMRs.
Our strategic partners may have interests that diverge from our interests, and which may hinder our ability to negotiate sales to customers. If we lose our agreements with strategic partners, we may need to find new contractors who may have less experience designing and building nuclear plants, or developing NuScale SMRs. This could substantially hinder our ability to expand our production capacity and installation of NuScale power plants and could affect our business and our prospects.
We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.
If our operations grow as planned, we may need to expand our sales and marketing, research and development, supply and manufacturing functions, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to scale the business and the manufacture of NPMs as planned, as there is no guarantee that we will be able to find suitable locations or partners for the expanded manufacture and operation of our NPMs or to broaden our internal capabilities.
23
Any failure to effectively incorporate updates to the design, construction and operations of NuScale SMR-based plants to ensure cost competitiveness could reduce the marketability of the NuScale design and has the potential to impact deployment schedules.
Updating the design, construction, and operations of NuScale SMR-based plants will be necessary to their competitiveness and attractiveness in the market, particularly in the United States where the price of power is generally lower than in other countries. If we are not able to achieve and maintain cost-competitiveness in the United States or elsewhere, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
If manufacturing and construction issues are not identified prior to design finalization, long-lead procurement, andor module fabrication, then those issues will be realized during production, fabrication or construction and may impact plant deployment cost and schedule.
Our NPM design will be actively managed through design reviews, prototyping, involvement of external partners and application of industry lessons, but we could still fail to identify latent manufacturing and construction issues early enough to avoid negative effects on production, fabrication, construction or ultimate performance of our NPMs or plants. Where these issues arise at such later stages of deployment, plant deployment could be subject to greater costs or be significantly delayed, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
We and our customers operate in a politically sensitive environment, and the public perception of nuclear energy can affect our customers and us.
The risks associated with radioactive materials and the public perception of those risks can affect our business. Opposition by third parties can delay or prevent the construction of new nuclear power plants and can limit the operation of nuclear reactors. Adverse public reaction to developments in the use of nuclear power could directly affect our customers and indirectly affect our business. In the past, adverse public reaction, increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation have contributed to extended construction periods for new nuclear reactors, sometimes delaying construction schedules by decades or more or even shutting down operations. In addition, anti-nuclear groups in Germany successfully lobbied for the adoption of the Nuclear Exit Law in 2002, under which all remaining nuclear power plants in Germany were shut down in April 2023. Adverse public reaction could also lead to increased regulation or limitations on the activities of our customers, more onerous operating requirements or other conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our customers and our business.
Accidents involving nuclear power facilities, including but not limited to events similar to the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accidents, or terrorist acts or other high-profile events involving radioactive materials, could materially and adversely affect our customers and the markets in which we operate and increase regulatory requirements and costs that could materially and adversely affect our business.
Our future prospects are dependent upon a certain level of public support for nuclear power. Nuclear power faces strong opposition from certain competitive energy sources, individuals and organizations. The accident that occurred at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011 increased public opposition to nuclear power in some countries, resulting in a slowdown in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to new construction of nuclear power plants, an early shut down of existing power plants or a dampening of the favorable regulatory climate needed to introduce new nuclear technologies, all of which could negatively impact our business and prospects. As a result of the Fukushima accident, some countries that were considering launching new domestic nuclear power programs delayed or cancelled the preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. If accidents similar to the Fukushima disaster or other events, such as terrorist attacks involving nuclear facilities, occur, public opposition to nuclear power may increase, regulatory requirements and costs could become more onerous and customer demand for our NPMs could suffer, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.
Our supply base may not be able to scale to the production levels necessary to meet sales projections.
NuScale does not have manufacturing assets and relies on third party manufacturers to build our NPMs and associated equipment. Moreover, we are dependent on future supplier capability to meet production demands attendant to our forecasts. If our supply chain cannot meet the schedule demands of the market, our projected sales revenues could be materially impacted.
24
Lack of availability, trade restrictions, tariffs and costs of component raw materials may affect the manufacturing processes for plant equipment and increase our costs.
Recent global supply chain disruptions have negatively affected both the availability and cost of raw materials, component manufacturing and deliveries. Such disruptions may result in delays in equipment deliveries and cost escalations that could adversely affect our business.
We are highly dependent on our senior management team and other highly skilled personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting or retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.
Our success depends, in significant part, on the continued services of our senior management team and on our ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of other highly skilled personnel, including engineers, manufacturing and quality assurance, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Our senior management team has extensive experience in the energy and manufacturing industries, and we believe that their depth of experience is instrumental to our continued success. The loss of any one or more members of our senior management team, for any reason, including resignation or retirement, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified and highly skilled replacement personnel.
We expect we will require additional future funding.
To date, we have not generated any material revenue, while we have substantial overhead expenses. We do not expect to generate meaningful revenue unless and until we are able to finalize development of and commercialize our SMR technology and related services, and we may not be able to do so on our anticipated timetable, if at all. Although we instituted the Plan in January 2024 to reduce our cost base and focus resources on key strategic areas, in the long term we expect our expenses and capital expenditures to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, including developing and advancing our SMR and other products and services, obtaining further NRC design certifications of and SDAs for our SMR and completing our manufacturing preparation and trials. We also incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Certain costs are not reasonably estimable at this time, and our projections anticipate certain customer-sourced income that is not guaranteed.
We may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants that restrict our operations including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our securities, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and members. If the needed financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than we expect, we may be required to delay, scale back or terminate some or all of our research and development programs.
If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.
As part of our arrangements with the DOE, we granted the DOE a worldwide, nonexclusive, paid-up license to our intellectual property and to manufacture our SMR technology, and the right to sublicense those rights if specified conditions arise, including if the DOE terminates the award due to material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or if we fail to meet our cost-sharing obligations or cease developing our SMR. As a result, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, the value of our intellectual property, including in liquidation, may be difficult to assess.
Our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights may be challenged and is not guaranteed, exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage.
We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and commercial agreements, such as confidentiality agreements, assignment agreements and license agreements, to protect the intellectual property associated with our NPMs and related technologies. These measures prevent third parties from using, practicing, selling,
25
manufacturing or otherwise commercially exploiting our NPMs and related technologies, which would erode our competitive position in our market. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our NPMs, as well as our ability to operate without infringing on or violating the proprietary rights of others. We own and have licensed rights to patents and pending patent applications and will continue to file patent applications claiming new technologies directed to NPMs in the United States and in other jurisdictions based on factors such as commercial viability.
As with all industries, the patent position of power modules and nuclear energy companies generally is uncertain and is not a guaranteed right. During the patent procurement process, a patent office may require us or our licensors to narrow the scope of the claims of our or our licensors pending and future patent applications. This may limit the scope of patent protection and our or our licensors ability to claim patent infringement if the patent application is subsequently issued. In some cases, a patent application may not issue if we or our licensors are unable to overcome rejections from a patent office. If a patent application does not issue, we or our licensors may lose trade secrets that are disclosed and published in the patent application and third parties may be able to exploit such published information in our patent application. Additionally, even if we obtain a patent registration in one jurisdiction (e.g., the United States), we cannot guarantee that we will obtain a patent registration for the same or related patent application in another jurisdiction (e.g., China) as patent laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, maintaining and enforcing patent rights can involve complex legal and factual questions and may be subject to litigation in some cases. For example, third parties may challenge the validity of our or our licensors patents based on prior art at a tribunal such as the Patent Trial and Appeal Board at the United States Patent and Trademark Office andor in a federal court. Because we cannot assure that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, third parties may prevail in invalidating a patent or preventing a patent application from being issued as a patent. If we or our licensors are able to maintain valid patents or prevail in patent challenges instituted by third parties, we or our licensors may still bear the risk of third parties designing around our technologies to avoid an intellectual property infringement claim.
We enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
We do not have worldwide patent rights for our NPMs and related technologies because there is no such thing as worldwide or international patent rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions and their legal systems. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our NPMs worldwide can pose several challenges. First, procuring patent rights in multiple jurisdictions would be cost prohibitive because individual patent offices in different jurisdictions will have to examine each patent application separately. Therefore, costs such as examination fees, translation fees and attorney fees are considered. Once a patent is registered, we or our licensors will also have the continued obligation of paying maintenance fees periodically to avoid patents from becoming abandoned or lapsed. Second, the breadth of claims in patents may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For instance, certain patent offices may require narrower claims, resulting in patent rights that are less extensive. Further, as noted above, we may not be able to obtain patents in some jurisdictions even if we obtain patents in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, our competitors may operate in countries where we do not have patent protection and can freely use our technologies and discoveries in such countries to the extent such technologies and discoveries are publicly known or disclosed in countries where we do have patent protection or pending patent applications.
In addition, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. Many countries also limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.
We may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market NPMs.
We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough because there may be hundreds of thousands of relevant patents worldwide. We also cannot be certain that we have identified every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of NPMs in any jurisdiction. The scope of a patent claim is generally determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent, and the patents prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending
26
application may be incorrect or not accepted by a court of competent jurisdiction. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect or inaccurate. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market NPMs.
In addition, there are several circumstances under which a patent application may not be published and accessible to us or our licensors. For example, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, but some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued. Publications in the scientific literature also often lag behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering NPMs or technology similar to ours without us knowing. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could require us to procure rights to issued patents covering such technologies in order to avoid infringement claims.
We may be subject to claims of ownership and other rights to our patents and other intellectual property by third parties.
Our confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors generally provide those inventions conceived by the party while rendering services to us will be our exclusive intellectual property. While we require our employees, consultants, and contractors to assign such intellectual property to us, if the intellectual property is not automatically assigned (e.g., as work made for hire), those agreements may not be honored and obligations to assign intellectual property may be challenged or breached. Moreover, there may be some circumstances where we are unable to negotiate for such ownership rights andor others misappropriate those rights in the process.
We may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an owner, a joint owner, a licensee, an inventor or a co-inventor. In the latter two cases, the failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are involved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our power modules or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve these and other claims challenging inventorship andor ownership. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose exclusive ownership of, or right to use or license valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.
Regulatory Risk Factors
Our SDA applications may not be approved, and any rework necessary to address NRC concerns could significantly delay the commercialization of our products.
At the end of 2022, we submitted SDA applications to approve a NuScale-based 6 plant design and to raise the licensed output of our NPM from 50 MWe to 77 MWe. The NRC accepted the application in July of 2023 and has begun the technical review. There is no assurance that the SDA will be approved, or approved in a timely manner (including as a result of recent personnel reductions in federal government and any future reductions), and any revisions necessary to address concerns the NRC may have could significantly delay the commercialization of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Our design is only approved in the United States, and we must obtain approvals on a country-by-country basis before we can complete the sale of our products abroad, which approvals may be delayed or denied or which may require modification to our design.
Our SMR design has not received regulatory approval in any country except the United States. Each country has its own safety approval that we must obtain before we can sell or install our NPMs abroad. Foreign approval processes may differ materially from the NRC process, and approvals may be denied or delayed in foreign countries, or some countries may require that we alter our design before obtaining approval. Denial or delay in approvals abroad could materially and adversely affect our business.
27
Our customers must obtain additional regulatory approvals before they construct power plants using our NPMs, and approvals may be denied or delayed.
The lead time to build a nuclear power facility is long and requires site licensing and approvals from applicable regulatory agencies before a plant can be constructed. The regulatory framework to obtain approvals is complex and varies from country to country. Any delays experienced by our customers in siting a power plant using our products and services could materially and adversely affect our business.
Our customers could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws.
The operations and properties of our customers are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. Although NuScales business is to design and sell technology rather than to construct and own or operate power plants, we must design our technology so it complies with such laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental requirements could require our customers to incur significant expenditures or result in significant restrictions on their operations, and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations, including failing to obtain any necessary permits, could result in substantial fines or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring our customers to conduct or fund remedial or corrective measures, install pollution control equipment or perform other actions. More vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, the future enactment of more stringent laws, regulations or permit requirements, including relating to climate change, or other unanticipated events may arise in the future and adversely impact the market for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to stringent United States export and import control laws and regulations. Unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations or United States government licensing policies, our failure to secure timely United States government authorizations under these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The inability to secure and maintain required export licenses or authorizations could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully or market our SMR technology for commercial applications outside the United States. For example, if we were unable to obtain or maintain our licenses to export certain nuclear hardware, we would be effectively prohibited from exporting our SMR technology in non-United States locations, which would limit the number of customers to those in the United States. In addition, if we were unable to obtain authorization to export our technology, hardware, code or technical assistance, we would experience a limited market for our technology, which would provide a competitive edge to international suppliers of SMRs. In both cases, these restrictions could lead to an adverse impact on our ability to sell our commercial technology. Similarly, if we were unable to secure export authorization, we may need to implement design changes to our NPM to address issues with our domestic supplier chain, which may increase costs or result in delays in delivery of new plants and subsequent additional NPMs when ordered.
Failure to comply with export control laws and regulations could expose us to civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges, debarment from government contracts or limitations on our ability to enter into contracts with the United States government. In addition, any changes in export control regulations or United States government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement United States government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations.
Our business is subject to a wide variety of extensive and evolving government laws and regulations. Changes in andor failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Regulatory risk factors associated with our business also include
our ability to obtain additional applicable approvals, licenses or certifications from regulatory agencies, if required, and to maintain current approvals, licenses or certifications
regulatory delays, delays imposed as a result of regulatory inspections, and changing regulatory requirements, may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill our existing or future orders, or cause planned plants to not be completed at all, many of which may be out of our control, including natural disasters, changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications or other events that force us to cancel or reschedule plant construction, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition and
28
challenges as a result of regulatory processes or in NuScales ability to secure the necessary permissions to establish these plant sites could delay our ability to achieve our target build rate and could adversely affect our business.
General Risk Factors
Any future widespread public health crises, similar to COVID-19, could negatively affect various aspects of our business, make it more difficult for us to meet our obligations to our customers, and result in reduced demand for our products and services.
In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of countries, including the United States, previously placed significant restrictions on travel, many businesses announced extended closures, and many businesses and governmental agencies allowed employees to work remotely, which in some cases may reduce the effectiveness of those employees. If there is a resurgence in COVID-19 cases or a similar health crisis, travel restrictions and business closures may in the future adversely affect our operations locally and worldwide, including our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and to manufacture, market, sell or distribute our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
We are subject to cybersecurity risks.
Like other businesses, we face cybersecurity risks. Threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities. These cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. We expect these cyberattacks to continue to occur in the future and we are constantly managing efforts to infiltrate and compromise our information technology systems and data. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. We, and the third parties on which we rely, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.
A cybersecurity breach, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, attacks by hackers, ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, supply chain attacks, breaches due to employee error or misconduct and other similar breaches, of our physical assets or information systems, or those of our vendors, business partners and interconnected entities or regulators could impact our operations or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor and employee data, trading or other confidential data. The risk of these system-related events and cybersecurity breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while we have not directly experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our operations to-date, such cyberattacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, and we may be unable to prevent all such cyberattacks in the future.
If a significant breach were to occur, our reputation could be negatively affected, customer confidence in us or others in the industry could be diminished, or we could be subject to legal claims, loss of revenues, increased costs or operations shutdown. In addition, our network and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result. Furthermore, in the future, such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
In addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by us or our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
Changes in tax laws or regulations may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect results of our operations and our effective tax rate.
We will be subject to taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in and duties imposed by various jurisdictions, including the United States, may be subject to change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by various tax jurisdictions. An adverse resolution by one or more taxing authorities could have a material impact on our finances. Further, we may be unable to utilize any net operating losses in the event a change in control is determined to have occurred.
29
We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.
We are currently named in a number of purported class action lawsuits (see Legal Proceedings), and from time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to other matters, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources from the operation of our business and cause us to incur significant expenses or liability or require us to change our business practices.
A shareholder class action lawsuit claims that NuScale and members of management made materially false andor misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Companys business, operations and prospects, and specifically about certain of the Companys agreements with customers. While two causes of action were filed, these lawsuits have been consolidated before the same judge in the federal district court in Oregon.
While we disagree with all of the plaintiffs claims included in the class action lawsuit, the risk of loss if plaintiffs prevail would be material to the Company. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Shares of Class A Common Stock
Our Organizational Documents designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between NuScale Corp and its stockholders.
Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (Organizational Documents) provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, shall be the exclusive forum for certain actions and claims. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with NuScale or any of its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. However, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived NuScale Corps compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, which provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts with respect to all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, or the Securities Act. Further, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, the Organizational Documents provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Organizational Documents to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The price of shares of Class A common stock may be volatile.
The price of shares of Class A common stock may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including
changes in the industries in which we and our customers operate
variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general
material and adverse impacts of pandemics such as COVID-19, on the markets and the broader global economy
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results
the publics reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC
our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market
additions and departures of key personnel
changes in laws and regulations affecting our business or industry
commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us
changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt
publication of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors or our industry
30
sales of shares of Class A common stock by our stockholders, including those who purchased shares of Class A common stock in private placements in connection with the Merger, or sales by us under our at the market offering arrangement described below and
general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, foreign currency fluctuations, international tariffs, social, political and economic risks and acts of war or terrorism.
These market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of shares of Class A common stock regardless of our operating performance.
A significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market. In addition, we and holders of equity awards, as well as holders of Class B units of NuScale LLC who receive shares of Class A common stock on exchange of those units (together with the cancellation of an equal number of shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock), may also sell additional shares into the market. This could cause the market price of shares of Class A common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well, and, if we are issuing new shares, result in dilution to stockholders.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of shares of Class A common stock. Fluor, our largest stockholder, has publicly stated its intention to sell down its position. On August 9, 2023, NuScale entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Canaccord Genuity LLC as sales agents under which the Company was able to offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 150,000,000 (the Prior ATM Program). During the year ended December31, 2024, the Company issued and sold 18,262,622 shares of Class A common stock for the gross and net proceeds of 139.0 million and 135.5 million, respectively, fully utilizing the Prior ATM Program.
On November 8, 2024, NuScale entered into a new Sales Agreement with TD Securities (USA) LLC, UBS Securities LLC, B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Canaccord Genuity LLC as sales agents under which the Company may offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to 200,000,000 (Current ATM Program). During the year ended December31, 2024, the Company issued and sold 3,264,524 shares of Class A common stock for the gross and net proceeds of 71.2 million and 69.2 million, respectively. As of December31, 2024, we have 21,735,476 shares of Class A common stock, at an aggregate sales price up to 128.8 million, eligible for sale under the Current ATM Program.
Subject to certain limitations in the Sales Agreement and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver a placement notice to the sales agents at any time throughout the term of the Sales Agreement. The number of shares that are sold by a sales agent after we deliver a placement notice will fluctuate based on the market price of the Class A common stock during the sales period and limits we set. Because the price per share of each share sold will fluctuate based on the market price of our Class A common stock during the sales period, it is not possible at this time to predict the number of shares that will be ultimately issued. Sales under the ATM Program, or any future similar programs or other issuance by us of shares, will result in dilution of existing stockholders.
As of December31, 2024, there were (i) 122,842,474 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, (ii) 154,254,663 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exchange of NuScale LLC Class B units (together with cancellation of an equal number of shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock) pursuant to the procedures set forth in the AR NuScale LLC Agreement, and (iii) 11,372,021 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).
We have registered on a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 to Form S-1, on Form S-3 (Commission File No. 333-264910), the potential resale of 202,912,854 shares of Class A common stock that otherwise could be subject to resale restrictions. We also have registered on a Form S-8 an aggregate of 32,503,809 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of options and other equity awards issued under the NuScale LLC Fourth Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan and the NuScale Corp 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The market price of shares of Class A common stock could decline if the holders of shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.
As part of a shelf registration on a Form S-3 (Commission File No. 333-272342), NuScale may offer Class A common stock, debt securities, warrants, andor units consisting of some or all of the securities in any combination, the aggregate offering price of securities of which must not exceed 500,000,000. The Company has used this registration statement for sales under both the Prior ATM Program and Current ATM Program. The market price of shares of Class A common stock could decline if the holders of shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.
NuScale Options will become exercisable for shares of Class A common stock, which, if exercised, would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.
31
Outstanding options exercisable in exchange for an aggregate of 6,365,141 shares of Class A common stock (NuScale Options) are or will become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of NuScale LLC. To the extent such options are exercised, additional shares of Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of Class A common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market prices of Class A common stock.
Investors ability to make transactions in our securities could be limited and if we cannot maintain our listing on the NYSE, we may be subject to additional trading restrictions.
An active trading market for our securities may not be sustained. In addition, we may be unable to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE in the future.
The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. If our securities were not listed on the NYSE or another national securities exchange, such securities would not qualify as covered securities, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities because states are not preempted from regulating the sale of securities that are not covered securities.
Reports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock.
Securities research analysts may establish and publish their own periodic projections for NuScale Corp. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline. Moreover, if no analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and volume for our common shares could be adversely affected.
We are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased and will continue to increase our costs and the risk of non-compliance.
We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including the SEC, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention.
Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.
We have in the past and may in the future be subject to short selling strategies that could result in a reduction in the market price of our Class A common stock.
Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date, at a lower price, to return to the lender and the short seller profits. Accordingly, it is in the short sellers best interests for the price of the stock to decline. At any time, short sellers may publish, or arrange for the dissemination of, opinions, or characterizations that are intended to create negative market momentum, including through the use of social media. In light of the recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence tools and large language models, there is also a risk that the dissemination of such opinions, characterizations or disinformation may negatively impact the conclusions that these tools and models draw about our business and prospects.
Short selling reports may potentially lead to increased volatility in an issuers stock price and to regulatory and governmental inquiries. In July 2024, October and November 2023, short sellers published reports that contained certain
32
negative and false allegations regarding our business and financial prospects. Regardless of merit, allegations and false statements by short sellers may spread quickly and diminish confidence in our business, financial prospects, or reputation. As a result, maintaining or reinforcing our reputation may require us to devote significant resources to refute incorrect or misleading allegations, to pursue or defend related legal actions, or to engage in other activities that could be costly, time consuming or unsuccessful. Additionally, any potential inquiry or formal investigation from a governmental organization or other regulatory body, including an inquiry from the SEC, arising from the presence of such allegations could result in a material diversion of our managements time and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.
The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are now, and may be in the future, the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
Risks Related to Being a Public Company
We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to remediate the material weakness or any other material weaknesses that we identify in the future could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price.
The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For further discussion of the material weakness, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.
We cannot provide assurance that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may be required to implement further remedial measures and to design enhanced processes and controls to address deficiencies. If we do not effectively remediate the material weakness identified by management and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to prepare reliable financial reports and comply with our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act on a timely basis. Any such delays in the preparation of financial reports and the filing of our periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, the market value of our common stock and our access to capital markets.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
The Board of Directors oversees managements processes for identifying and mitigating risks, including cybersecurity risks, to help align our risk exposure with our strategic objectives. Senior leadership, including our Chief Compliance Officer and Vice President, Information Technology (IT), regularly brief the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity and
33
information security posture and the Board of Directors is apprised of any cybersecurity incidents deemed to have a moderate or higher business impact. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is briefed by senior leadership, as appropriate, on the cybersecurity of DOE and NRC programs and the security of our business supply chain. Other than oversight of business cybersecurity, the full Board retains oversight of cybersecurity because of its importance to NuScale and the heightened risk in the nuclear power sector. In the event of an incident, we intend to follow our incident response playbook, which outlines the steps to be followed from incident detection to mitigation, recovery and notification, including notifying functional areas (e.g. legal), as well as senior leadership and the Board, as appropriate.
Our corporate information security organization, led by our Vice President, IT, is responsible for our overall information security strategy, policy, security engineering, operations and cyber threat detection and response. The current Vice President, IT has extensive information technology and program management experience, has over a decade of experience leading cybersecurity oversight, and others on our IT security team have cybersecurity experience or certifications, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification. The corporate information security organization manages and continually enhances a robust enterprise security structure with the ultimate goal of preventing cybersecurity incidents to the extent feasible, while simultaneously increasing our system resilience in an effort to minimize the business impact should an incident occur.
The corporate information security organization has implemented a governance structure and processes to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks. For the current reporting period, there have been no incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect NuScale, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. As a nuclear contractor, we must comply with extensive regulations, including requirements imposed by the DOE and NRC, related to adequately protecting safeguards information and reporting cybersecurity incidents to the DOE and NRC when required. We have implemented cybersecurity policies and frameworks based on industry and governmental standards to align closely with DOE and NRC requirements, instructions and guidance. In addition to following DOE and NRC guidance and implementing pre-existing third party frameworks, we have developed our own practices, which we believe enhance our ability to identify and manage cybersecurity risks.
Third parties also play a role in our cybersecurity. We engage third-party services to conduct around the clock monitoring and prevention of suspected malicious activity on company-owned systems, filter all email and web browser activity, provide proactive threat intelligence services, and perform regular evaluations of our security controls, whether through external and internal network penetration testing, physical security assessments, independent audits or consulting. These evaluations include testing both the design and operational effectiveness of security controls. We also share and receive threat intelligence with our nuclear design and construction partners, government agencies, information sharing and analysis centers and cybersecurity associations.
Assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity related risks are integrated into our overall enterprise risk management (ERM) process. Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe that the ERM function evaluates to assess top risks to the enterprise on an annual basis. To the extent the ERM process identifies a heightened cybersecurity related risk, risk owners are assigned to develop risk mitigation plans, which are then tracked to completion. The ERM processs annual risk assessment is presented by the Senior Director, Treasury, SOX, ERM and ESG to the Board of Directors.
We rely heavily on our supply chain to deliver our products and services to our customers, and a cybersecurity incident at a supplier, subcontractor or joint venture partner could materially adversely impact us. We assess third party cybersecurity controls through a cybersecurity questionnaire and include security and privacy addendums to our contracts where applicable. We also contractually flow cybersecurity regulatory requirements to our subcontractors as required by government agency-specific requirements. These contractual flow downs include the requirement that our subcontractors implement certain security controls. We also require that our subcontractors report cybersecurity incidents to us so that we can assess the impact of the incident on us. For select suppliers, we engage third-party cybersecurity monitoring and alerting services, and seek to work directly with those suppliers to address potential deficiencies identified. We also make available cybersecurity education and awareness materials and briefings to our suppliers, as necessary.
Notwithstanding the extensive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While NuScale Power maintains cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.
Item 2. Properties
Our executive offices and our engineering and design center is located in 1100 Circle Blvd, Suite 200 and 350, Corvallis, OR, 97330. This location houses 43 full-time and 106 hybrid employees, with capacity for 340, in approximately 55,000 square feet of office, computing, and storage space. Technical and related support activities such as engineering, design, operations, testing, code development, quality assurance, licensing and project management are performed at this facility.
34
Our full-scale reactor control room simulator and computational computing cluster are also located at this facility. NuScale personnel use the computational cluster in a secure data center to perform structural, thermal hydraulic, fluid dynamics and neutronics calculations. We believe the location of our Corvallis facilities provides us with unique access to the technical expertise found in Oregon State University, one of the largest nuclear engineering programs on the west coast. In addition, we lease properties in the following locations
Houston, TX. The Houston office, a leased property with approximately 773 square feet, is used to support various members of the Finance team.
Rockville, MD.The Rockville office, a 1,973 square foot leased property, has been a key enabler for the NuScale strategy of early, frequent, and responsive interaction with the NRC.
On January 18, 2024, a fire broke out in the building housing the Companys Portland, Oregon office, which destroyed the Companys office. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. No one was injured in the fire and no critical records were lost. The office was set up for temporary use with no employees using it full time as a result, losses were limited to furniture, a copier and computer systems. The Company carries insurance that will cover these losses, which were not material. Executives and other employees previously using that office are working remotely or commuting to the Companys Corvallis, Oregon, office as needed. The Company terminated the lease in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
In the regular course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal course of business. Other than as disclosed immediately below, the Company does not believe that any legal claims are material to the Company. Management does not believe that resolution of any of these matters will materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors above for further discussion of how certain risks, including risks related to litigation, may affect the Company.
On September 19, 2022, thirteen purported members andor option holders of NuScale LLC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against NuScale LLC, Fluor Enterprises, Japan NuScale Innovation, Inc., and Sargent  Lundy Holdings, LLC. The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of individuals who held common units or options to purchase common units in NuScale LLC and seek declaratory relief and damages based on breach of contract and other common law claims. The claims in the complaint are based on amendments to the operating agreement of NuScale LLC in connection with NuScale LLCs combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. On November 21, 2022, NuScale LLC, along with the other defendants, filed motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs filed a response on January 17, 2023, and NuScale LLC and the other defendants filed a reply on February 14, 2023. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was held on May 17, 2023. On August 3, 2023, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation that recommended that NuScale LLCs motion to dismiss be denied. On August 17, 2023, NuScale LLC filed an objection to this report and recommendation. On November 13, 2023, the District Court Judge entered an order accepting the report and recommendation. On December 8, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint, and on June 23, 2024, the Court denied this motion. Subsequent to year end, on February 13, 2025, the parties resolved the lawsuit and the complaint has been dismissed with prejudice.
Multiple shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the Company and certain of its current or former officers, namely John Hopkins, Chris Colbert, Robert Hamady and Clayton Scott (1) Sigman v. NuScale Power Corp., et al. (Case No. 23-1689, filed November 15, 2023), and (2) Ryckewaert v. NuScale Power Corp., et al. (Case No. 23-1956, filed December 26, 2023). These lawsuits assert virtually identical allegations and claims and were consolidated before the same judge on February 2, 2024. The lawsuits assert claims under the federal securities laws and allege that the Company and members of management made materially false andor misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Companys business, operations and prospects, and specifically about certain of the Companys agreements with customers. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 18, 2024 that makes similar allegations as the original complaints. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 17, 2024, and plaintiff filed a brief in opposition on August 1, 2024. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs indicated they intended to seek leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to add allegations relating to the Companys disclosure about the SEC inquiry disclosed below. Defendants consented to plaintiffs request to amend, with the express caveat that defendants believed the proposed amendment to be futile and defendants would move to dismiss any Second Amended Complaint, including any new allegations. On September 20, 2024, plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint, and on November 1, 2024, defendants moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs responded to Defendants motion to dismiss on December 17, 2024, and Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss on January 24, 2025. The motion is now pending and awaiting a decision. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company does not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the Company has not recorded any liability as a result of these actions.
35
On December 10, 2024, a purported class action lawsuit titled Tucker v. NuScale Power Corporation, et al., Case No. 2024-1272-NAC (Del. Ch. Ct.) was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The lawsuit names the Company, eight current board members and one former board member as defendants. The lawsuit broadly alleges that the Companys corporate opportunity waiver provision contained in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation is overbroad and impermissibly waives certain fiduciary duties in contradiction to state statutory law. The named plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, certification as class representative, and costs, fees and damages for a to-be certified class of plaintiffs. This lawsuit is in its early stages.
In December 2023, the Company received a voluntary request from the SECs Denver Regional Office for information relating to its employment, severance, and confidentiality agreements. The Company has responded to those requests and intends to fully cooperate with the SEC. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of the SECs investigation at this time.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements as of and for the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 together with related notes thereto. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to NuScale, the Company, us,
37
our or we refer to NuScale Power, LLC (NuScale LLC) prior to the Transaction, and to NuScale Power Corporation (NuScale Corp) following the consummation of the Transaction.
Overview
Our mission is to provide scalable advanced nuclear technology to produce electricity, heat and clean water to improve the quality of life for people around the world. We are changing the power that changes the world by creating an energy source that is smarter, cleaner, safer and cost competitive.
Our small modular reactor (SMR), known as NuScale Power Module (NPM), provides a scalable power plant solution incorporating enhanced safety, improved affordability and extended flexibility for diverse electrical and process heat applications. Our scalable design provides carbon-free energy at a reduced cost when compared with gigawatt-sized nuclear facilities.
Since our founding in 2007, we have made significant progress towards commercializing the first SMR in the United States. In 2017, we submitted our Design Certification Application (DCA) to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). On August 28, 2020, the NRC issued its Final Safety Evaluation Report, representing the NRCs completion of its technical review. On September 11, 2020, the NRC issued its Standard Design Approval (SDA) of our NPM and scalable plant design. With this phase of NuScales DCA now complete, customers may proceed with plans to develop NuScale SMR-based power plants with the understanding that the NRC has approved the safety aspects of the NPM and plant design. We expect our operating losses and negative operating cash flow to grow until the commercialization of the NPM. On January 19, 2023, the NRC published in the Federal Register a final rule that certifies NuScales SMR design for use in the United States, which became effective 30 days after publication.
In January 2023, the Company submitted an SDA Application and the associated licensing topical reports to the NRC for NuScales 6-unit 77 MWe NPM design. Once approved, customers in the United States will be able to reference the certified design and SDA for expedited construction and operating licensing of NuScales SMR pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. On July 31, 2023, the NRC formally announced that it has accepted the Companys SDA Application for formal review. Based on the NRCs published schedule for SDA Application review, we expect the NRC will complete its review and SDA approval will be received by mid-year 2025.
The Company currently has only one Class 1 customer RoPower Nuclear S.A. (RoPower), which is a joint venture established by S.N. Nuclearelectrica S.A. (Nuclearelectrica) and Nova Power  Gas S.A. In November 2023, we entered into the Release Agreement with CFPP LLC, the Companys first customer, pursuant to which the Company agreed to terminate the Development Cost Reimbursement Agreement (DCRA), as amended, and our Long Lead Material Reimbursement Agreement (LLM Agreement). CFPP LLC was receiving funding for approximately 79% of its qualified project costs, including the long-lead materials (LLM), under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE). Under the Release Agreement, we agreed to repay CFPP LLCs Net Development Costs. Upon final settlement of the LLM Agreement, and once DOE is compensated for its investment in the LLM (stemming from DOEs funding under its cost share agreement with CFPP LLC), NuScale will obtain all rights and obligations associated with the LLM.
Merger with Spring Valley
In December 2021, NuScale LLC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. (Spring Valley) and Spring Valley Merger Sub, LLC (Merger Sub), a wholly owned subsidiary of Spring Valley. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into NuScale LLC (the Merger), with NuScale LLC surviving the Merger (the Surviving Company), Spring Valley being renamed NuScale Corp, and NuScale LLC continuing to be held as a wholly controlled subsidiary of NuScale Power Corporation in an Up-C structure. On May 2, 2022, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (collectively the Transaction) were completed.
The Transaction is shown as a reverse recapitalization under GAAP. Spring Valley is the acquired company, with NuScale LLC treated as the acquirer. This determination reflects Legacy NuScale Equityholders holding a majority of the voting power of NuScale Corp, NuScale LLCs pre-merger operations being the majority post-merger operations of NuScale Corp and NuScale LLCs management team retaining similar roles at NuScale Corp. Accordingly, although NuScale Corp (fka Spring Valley) is the parent company, GAAP dictates that the financial statements of NuScale Corp represent a continuation of NuScale LLCs operations, with the Transaction being treated as though NuScale LLC issued ownership interests for Spring Valley, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of NuScale LLC are stated at historical cost,
38
with no incremental goodwill or other intangible assets recorded for the effects of the Transaction. The consummation of the Transaction resulted in NuScale LLC receiving cash equal to 341.5 million and assuming Warrant liabilities valued at 47.5 million.
Key Factors Affecting Our Prospects and Future Results
We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including competition from carbon-based and other non-carbon-based energy generators, the risk of perceived safety issues and their consequences for our reputation and the other factors discussed under the section titled Risk Factors. We believe the factors described below are key to our success.
Commencing and Expanding Commercial Launch Operations
In September 2020, we became the first and only company to receive NRC SDA for a small modular reactor. We believe our commercialization activities are being completed at a pace that can support delivery of NPMs to a client site as early as 2029. In December 2022, we signed a contract for Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) work with RoPower to advance the deployment of our NPMs to Romania. Under Phase 1 of the contract, we defined the major site and specific inputs for a NuScale 6-module power plant to be deployed at the Doicesti Power Station site in Romania. We expect the site in Romania to use six modules and to be commercially operable as early as 2030.
We believe the long lead-time involved with siting an SMR, the number of potential customers in our pipeline and the work being performed by these potential customers involving a NuScale deployment project bode well for our potential future success. Further, in December 2022, we completed our Standard Plant Design (SPD), which provides potential customers with a generic NuScale-based power plant design that will serve as a starting point for deploying site-specific designs, including supporting client licensing and deployment activities.
Regulatory Approvals
In January 2023, the Company submitted an SDA Application and the associated licensing topical reports to the NRC for a NuScales 6-unit 77 MWe NPM design. Once approved, customers in the United States will be able to reference the certified design and SDA for expedited construction and operating licensing of NuScales SMR pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. On July 31, 2023, the NRC formally announced that it has accepted the Companys SDA Application for review. Based on the NRCs published schedule for SDA Application review, we expect the NRC will complete its review and SDA approval to be received by mid-year 2025.
Other factors that we believe are critical to our future success are country-level approvals of our NPM design. We also believe site-approvals by our customers to be key to facilitating broader adoption of our products and services. Obtaining these approvals before others is critical in maintaining our competitive advantage.
Key Components of Results of Operations
Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results. Accordingly, the drivers of our future financial results, as well as the components of such results, may not be comparable to our historical or future results of operations.
Revenue
All revenue that we have generated to date arises from engineering and licensing fees and services provided to potential customers, including those as a result of the FEED services. We expect to generate a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of NPMs. We also expect to generate revenue by providing critical services, such as start-up and testing and nuclear fuel and refueling services, over the life cycle of each power plant.
Expenses
Research and Development Expense
Our research and development (RD) expenses consist primarily of internal and external expenses incurred in connection with our RD activities. These expenses include labor directly performed on our projects and fees paid to third parties working on and testing specific aspects of our NPM design. RD costs have been expensed as incurred.
39
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative (GA) expenses consist of compensation costs for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, human resources and other administrative functions. GA expenses also include legal fees, advertising and marketing, professional fees paid for accounting, auditing and consulting services, insurance costs and facility costs.
Other Expense
Other operating expenses consist primarily of compensation costs (including indirect benefits and equity-based compensation expense) for operating personnel.
Sponsored Cost Share
As our commercialization activities advance, we have continued to enter into cost share agreements with various entities, including both governmental and private, under which the Company is reimbursed for specific RD activities. Generally, as our qualifying operating costs change, there is a corresponding change in the reimbursable amounts. The amount of any reimbursement is recognized in the period that we recognize the qualifying expenses.
Income Tax Effects
NuScale LLC was historically and remains a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes with each partner being separately taxed on its share of taxable income or loss. NuScale Corp is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to its distributive share of any net taxable income or loss and any related tax credits of NuScale LLC.

Comparison of the Years Ended December31, 2024 and 2023
Revenue and Cost of Sales
The increase in revenue was attributable to engineering and licensing fees and services in support of advancing RoPowers goal of deploying a NuScale 6-module power plant in Romania.
40
RD Expense
RD expenses decreased significantly during the 2024 fiscal year as the Company is transitioning from an RD-based company to a commercial company. In doing so, management was able to implement various internal cost optimization measures, which resulted in savings in personnel costs of 8.4 million and professional fees of 50.4 million. Further, the 2023 fiscal year saw the termination of the CFPP contract and the Release Agreement payment and expense of 49.8 million.
GA Expenses
GA expenses increased as a result of higher marketing and advertising spend as we continue to build brand recognition across the globe, the write-off of uncollectible receivables and professional fees to help the Company navigate from an RD-based company to a commercial company.
Other Expense
Other expenses decreased as a result of savings associated with managements cost optimization measures and decrease in discretionary spending resulting in savings of 9.8 million in personnel costs, equity-based compensation and general costs.
Sponsored Cost Share
Sponsored cost share decreased due to the Company hitting the cost share cap with DOE, USTDA and RoPower and the termination of the CFPP contract.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities
The price of the Warrants, which is used to calculate their fair value, has significantly increased year-over year driven by a rising stock price as the market realizes the advantages NuScales technology brings to the energy industry, and the Company redeemed all outstanding Warrants in the fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year.
Foreign income taxes
During the 2024 fiscal year, the Company executed a contract with an entity based out of Romania resulting in income tax being withheld to pay the Romanian taxing authority.
Comparison of the Years Ended December31, 2023 and 2022
Changes in Presentation
For the year ended December 31, 2022, sponsored cost share totaling 0.2 million that was previously included in Interest income (expense) has been reclassified to Sponsored cost share to conform to the current year presentation on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. No such reclassifications were required for 2023.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, amounts totaling 4.2 million and 3.5 million were reclassified out of GA expenses and into RD expenses and Other expenses, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. No such reclassification was required in 2023.
Revenue
The increase in revenue was attributable to activities in support of the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Development Agreement for CFPP, as well as nuclear technologies consulting services.
41
RD Expense
RD expenses increased due to the Release Agreement with CFPP in the amount of 49.8 million, partially offset by lower compensation costs of 8.7 million as we transition from RD to commercialization activities, as well as lower professional fees.
GA Expenses
GA expenses increased as a result of 4.3 million in compensation costs due to an increase in headcount and 7.3 million in marketing and advertising costs as we continue to build brand recognition across the globe, partially offset by lower professional fees.
Other Expense
Other expenses increased as a result of higher equity-based compensation of 4.1 million and higher software license expenses of 2.8 million, partially offset by lower compensation costs.
Sponsored Cost Share
Sponsored cost share decreased due to a lower share percentage and funding from the DOE, partially offset by increases in United States Trade and Development Agency and subrecipient cost share for other projects.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities
The price of the Warrants, which is used to calculate their fair value, has decreased year-over year resulting in larger income in the current period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On November 8, 2024, NuScale entered into a new Sales Agreement with TD Securities (USA) LLC, UBS Securities LLC, B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Canaccord Genuity LLC as sales agents under which the Company may offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to 200.0 million (ATM Program). During the year ended December31, 2024, the Company issued and sold 3,264,524 shares of Class A common stock for the gross and net proceeds of 71.2 million and 69.2 million, respectively. As of December31, 2024, we have 21,735,476 shares of Class A common stock, at an aggregate sales price up to 128.8 million, eligible for sale under the ATM Program.
Previous to the current ATM Program, the Company fully utilized a similar agreement under which the Company offered and sold 20,000,000 shares of the Companys Class A common stock. During the year ended December31, 2024, the Company issued and sold 18,262,622 shares of Class A common stock for the gross and net proceeds of 139.0 million and 135.5 million, respectively, while during the year ended December31, 2023, the Company issued and sold 1,737,378 shares of Class A common stock for the gross and net proceeds of 10.4 million and 9.8 million, respectively.
Subsequent to December31, 2024, the Company issued and sold 4,548,127 shares of Class A common stock for the gross and net proceeds of 102,416 and 99,855, respectively, under the ATM Program.
On November 19, 2024, the Company provided notice in accordance with its Warrant Agreement dated November 23, 2020 between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer  Trust Company, as warrant agent, of the redemption of all Warrants outstanding as of 500 p.m., New York City time, on December 19, 2024 (the Redemption Time). As of the Redemption Time, 599,440 Warrants were outstanding and were redeemed by NuScale for 0.01 per Warrant. During the year ended December31, 2024, Warrant holders exercised 17,859,261 Warrants for Class A common shares and 205.4 million in cash. There were no Warrants outstanding as of December31, 2024.
Since NuScales inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of 377.1 million, with negative operating cash flows. As of December31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 401.6 million and restricted cash of 5.1 million with no debt, while using 108.7 million of cash in operations. Historically, our primary sources of cash included investment capital, government grants and government sponsored cost share agreements to support the advancement of the Companys SMR technology both domestically and abroad. As we transition from a focus on research and development to commercialization of our technology, the Company is focusing on revenue producing
42
commercial contracts. During the year ended December31, 2024, the Company executed two revenue generating agreements in relation to the advancement of Doicesti project Phase 2 Front-End Engineering Design, a project which targets the development of six NuScale power modules at a former coal plant site in Doicesti, Romania.
On January 5, 2024, NuScale announced a plan to reduce the Companys workforce by 154 full-time employees, or 28%, in order to continue our transition from an RD-based company to a commercial company. This resulted in a one-time charge of 3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and is included in Other expenses on our consolidated income statement.
We believe that based on our current level of operating expenses and currently available cash resources, we will have sufficient funds available to cover RD activities and operating cash needs for the next twelve months. However, considering that we have not yet completed the development of a commercial product and have minimal revenue to date, we may require additional funds in future years. Further, management plans to prudently manage its expenses and cash reserves into the future, recognizing the need to secure additional customer commitments to support long-term operations. For additional information on our potential need for future funding, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.
The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented below

Comparison of Cash Flowsfor the Years Ended December31, 2024 and 2023
Cash Flows used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in our operating activities decreased during the year ended December31, 2024, as management was able to implement cost optimization measures while transitioning from an RD company to a commercial company. In addition, the Company did not incur any termination fees similar to the 49.8 million payment to CFPP associated with the Release Agreement made in the 2023 fiscal year.
Cash Flows used in Investing Activities
The majority of the Companys investing cash flows result from the purchase and sale of short-term investments, with minimal capital expenditures annually.
Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities
The Companys financing activities consist of proceeds arising from utilizing our ATM sales and the exercise of options and warrants. The current year saw much higher ATM activity, as management took advantage of a rising stock price to increase our cash balance by 204.6 million as we continue to fund business development measures. In connection with NuScales announced redemption of the outstanding Warrants, Warrant exercises prior to the redemption time on December 19, 2024 resulted in approximately 205.4 million in proceeds, while the remaining increase in cash resulted from stock option exercises.
Comparison of Cash Flowsfor the Years Ended December31, 2023 and 2022
Cash Flows used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in our operating activities increased during year ended December31, 2023 due to the Release Agreement payment to CFPP LLC in the amount of 49.8 million, partially offset by a buildup of our accounts payables and accruals associated with the manufacture of our long-lead materials.
43
Cash Flows used in Investing Activities
Investing cash flows generally reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software. However, in 2022, we invested 50 million in short-term investments, while in 2023, we sold those short-term investments.
Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities
During 2023, our cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from our ATM sales and the exercise of options, while in 2022 the majority of the cash consisted of proceeds from the Transaction, with another 28.7 million received for the exercise of warrants and options.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
We do not have any material commitments and contractual obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Under the Release Agreement, the Company is required to have credit support to fund the amount of its potential reimbursement of demobilization and wind down costs with CFPP LLC. This account is identified as restricted cash in the amount of 5.1 million, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and acts as collateral for the 5.0 million letter of credit outstanding at December31, 2024.
Effective January 1, 2025, the Company entered into sales and marketing agreements in the amount of 34.8 million for services to be performed ratably over the 2025 fiscal year.
From time to time, NuScale enters into technical assistance grant programs with the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), whereby the Company receives cost share commitments to support licensing work in foreign markets. Under these programs, NuScale has agreed to pay the USTDA a certain percentage of all revenue earned in a geographic area or associated with a specific contract. Should NuScale earn revenue under the guidelines of these programs, the Company could owe the USTDA for funds previously received, or up to 7.4 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 within our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information about our critical accounting policies follows
Revenue Recognition
In addition to advancing the commercialization of our SMR, we provide engineering and licensing services to customers.
We recognize fixed price contract revenue with multiple performance obligations as each obligation is completed. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time we recognize revenue when delivery of the promised good has occurred or the service has been rendered. For performance obligations satisfied over time we use the cost to cost input method to estimate the amount to recognize. Revenue recognized on contracts that has not been billed to customers is classified as a current asset under accounts and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as a current liability under deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet.
NuScale has also executed contracts that include variable consideration. The variable consideration is recognized subject to appropriate constraints, as required by GAAP, to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in future periods. Management reviews the Companys variable consideration on at least a quarterly basis. The only significant contract with variable consideration outstanding at December31, 2024, is a time and material contract that will be recognized as services are provided, until the customers goals are achieved or the contract terminates.
44
Revenue recognition and profit is dependent upon a number of factors, including the accuracy of a variety of estimates made at the balance sheet date, such as engineering progress, material quantities, the achievement of milestones, penalty provisions, labor productivity and cost estimates. We continuously monitor factors that may affect the quality of our estimates, and material changes in estimates are disclosed accordingly.
We exclude all taxes assessed by governmental authorities from our measurement of transaction prices that are both
(i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of sales.
We generally provide limited warranties for work performed under our engineering contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of our work.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Limitations of the Effectiveness of Control
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness described below, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the year ended December31, 2024 because of the material weakness described below.
45
Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
During the audit process related to our fiscal year ended December31, 2024, management identified a material weakness in the design, implementation and documentation of (i) information technology general controls (ITGC) and (ii) internal controls across key financial reporting processes, which are necessary for the Company to achieve complete, accurate and timely reporting due to an insufficient complement of personnel, level of technical accounting and IT support within those areas to design and operate the controls.
Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, the Companys management, including our CEO and CFO, have determined, based on the procedures we have performed, that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December31, 2024 in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness
In order to remediate the material weakness, we plan to invest significantly in the critical resources to our team as well as in the support of our IT environment. The below areas will be our focus to remediate the material weakness
Hiring of additional qualified personnel that have the appropriate level of technical accounting experience to enhance our control environment, including the expansion of formal financial reporting controls. Additionally, we will design and implement effective review and approval controls, as well as implement appropriate timely review and oversight responsibilities within the financial reporting function.
Engage expert SOX consultants to assist in the coordination, design, and testing of our control environment and deficiency remediation efforts, including ITGC and business processes
Conduct trainings for control owners covering proper control design, execution and review documentation, and source data validation
Design and implement additional ITGCs to manage access and program changes across our key systems and improve IT-dependent and application controls for our in-scope systems.
We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until all of these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We will incur significant costs in connection with these remediation efforts, and expect these efforts to require significant additional time, expense, and demands on our financial and operational resources. At this time, we cannot provide an estimate of the total costs expected to be incurred in connection with these remediation efforts.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Other than the remediation measures discussed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of NuScale Power Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited NuScale Power Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, NuScale Power Corporation (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment. Management has identified a material weakness related to insufficient design, implementation and documentation of information technology (IT) general controls and internal controls across key financial reporting processes, which are necessary for the Company to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial reporting due to an insufficient complement of personnel, level of technical accounting and IT support within those areas to design and operate the related controls.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 3, 2025, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
47
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of NuScale Power Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NuScale Power Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
	Revenue recognition on revenue contracts
Description of the Matter	
As described in Note 3 and 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company identifies performance obligations within its contracts and recognizes revenue either at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of those performance obligations. Identifying the separate performance obligations within the revenue contracts and determining the amount of revenue that should be recognized involves judgment due to the unique and non-standard nature of the contracts the Company enters.
Auditing the Companys application of the revenue recognition framework was especially challenging as it requires judgments related to the Companys identification of performance obligations and determination of the timing of revenue recognition.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit	To test the Companys application of the revenue recognition framework including the identification of performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition, including variable consideration, our audit procedures included, among others, reading significant contracts, evaluating key terms and conditions within the contracts to determine their accounting implications and evaluating managements judgments around the identification of separate performance obligations within the revenue contracts and the timing of revenue recognition.

We have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.

(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
1. The Company
Organization
NuScale Corp (NuScale, the Company, us, we or our) is incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company is the primary beneficiary of NuScale LLC, a variable interest entity, and all activity of NuScale LLC and the Company are consolidated herein. NuScale LLC is a limited liability company organized in theState of Oregon in 2011.
Operations
The Company is commercializing a modular, scalable electric Light Water Reactor nuclear power plant, with 77 megawatt (gross) NPMs, using exclusive rights to a nuclear power plant design obtained from Oregon State University (OSU). The Company also uses the test facility at OSU through a technology transfer agreement. The following represents key milestones in the development of this technology
December2016 Design Certification Application (DCA) completed
January2017 DCA submitted to the NRC
March2017 DCA accepted for review by the NRC
August2020 NRC issued the Final Safety Evaluation Report (FSER)
July 2023 SDA Application and associated licensing topical reports accepted for formal review by the NRC
The FSER represents the NRCs completion of its technical review and approval of the NuScale SMR design. With this final phase of NuScales DCA now complete, customers may proceed with plans to develop NuScale SMR-based power plants with the understanding that the NRC has approved the safety aspects of the NuScale design. Based on the NRCs published schedule for SDA Application review, we expect the NRC will complete its review and SDA approval to be received by the end of the 2025 fiscal year.
The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure funding to sustain operations until our SDA applications are approved by the NRC, we reach commercialization and secure customers.
The majority of the Companys operations and long-lived assets were attributable to operations in the United States other than the long-lead material work in process being manufactured in South Korea during the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years.
On January 5, 2024, NuScale announced a plan to reduce the Companys workforce by 154 full-time employees, or 28%, in order to continue our transition from an RD-based company to a commercial company. This resulted in a one-time charge of 3,236 during the year ended December 31, 2024, and is included in Other expenses on our consolidated income statement.
U.S. Department of Energy Funding
Beginning in 2014, the U.S. DOE has provided critical funding to NuScale through a series of cooperative agreements which support ongoing commercialization activities. The relevant agreements are discussed below.
U.S. Department of Energy NuScale SMR FOAK Nuclear Demonstration Readiness Project Completion (Award 8928)
In February 2020, NuScale LLC was awarded up to 350,000 under SMR FOAK Nuclear Demonstration Readiness Project Completion (Award 8928). This program is expected to complete all remaining licensing activities, first-of-a-kind engineering, supply chain development, testing and other required activities to have the NuScale SMR ready to enable timely client project deployment. The award consisted of NuScale cost share of 350,000 (50%) and government cost share of 350,000 (50%). Subsequently the award has been amended and DOE obligated 262,656, of which NuScale has collected a total of 262,655 through December31, 2024, with no future obligations guaranteed.

2.Merger Transaction
Merger with Spring Valley
In December 2021, NuScale LLC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. (Spring Valley) and Spring Valley Merger Sub, LLC (Merger Sub), a wholly owned subsidiary of Spring Valley. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into NuScale LLC (the Merger), with NuScale LLC surviving the Merger (the Surviving Company), Spring Valley being renamed NuScale Power Corporation, and NuScale LLC continuing to be held as a wholly controlled subsidiary of NuScale Corp in an Up-C structure. On May 2, 2022, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (collectively the Transaction) was completed.
The Transaction is shown as a reverse recapitalization under GAAP. Spring Valley is the acquired company, with NuScale LLC treated as the acquirer. This determination reflects Legacy NuScale Equityholders holding a majority of the voting power of NuScale Corp, NuScale LLCs pre-merger operations being the majority post-merger operations of NuScale Corp and NuScale LLCs management team retaining similar roles at NuScale Corp. Accordingly, although NuScale Corp (fka Spring Valley) is the parent company, GAAP dictates that the financial statements of NuScale Corp represent a continuation of NuScale LLCs operations, with the Transaction being treated as though NuScale LLC issued ownership interests for Spring Valley, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of NuScale LLC are stated at historical cost, with no incremental goodwill or other intangible assets recorded for the effects of the Transaction.
In connection with the Transaction
Each Convertible Preferred Unit of NuScale LLC was converted into common units using an exchange ratio, and each NuScale LLC common unit holder (including the holders of the previously converted Convertible Preferred Units) received a certain number of NuScale LLC Class B units and non-economic voting shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock based on an exchange ratio. Holders of NuScale LLC Class B units have the right to exchange each Class B unit, together with the cancellation for no consideration of one share of NuScale Corp Class B common stock, par value 0.0001, for one share of NuScale Corp Class A common stock, par value 0.0001, or cash, subject to certain restrictions.
Institutional and accredited investors purchased 23,700,002 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of 235,000.
The consummation of the Transaction resulted in NuScale LLC receiving cash equal to 341,500 and assuming Warrant liabilities valued at 47,500.
Tax Receivable Agreement
Substantially all the assets of the combined company are held by NuScale LLC, and NuScale Corps only assets are its equity interest in NuScale LLC and prepaid assets. NuScale Corp entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA) with NuScale LLC, each of the TRA Holders (as defined in the TRA), and Fluor, in its capacity as TRA Representative (as defined in the TRA). Pursuant to the TRA, NuScale Corp must pay 85% of the net cash tax savings from certain tax benefits, if any, that it realizes (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of any increases in tax basis and other tax benefits resulting from any exchange by the TRA holders of NuScale LLC Class B units and NuScale Corp Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock or cash in the future.
NuScale Corp will benefit from the remaining 15% of cash tax savings, if any, realized as a result of such tax benefits. Cash tax savings will be computed by comparing NuScale Corps actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NuScale Corp would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of its assets as a result of the Transaction or the exchanges and had NuScale Corp not entered into the TRA (calculated by making certain assumptions).
As of December31, 2024, there have been 24,142,048 Class B units exchanged (together with the cancellation for no consideration of an equal number of shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock. Associated with these exchanged units we have calculated an implied TRA obligation of 63,360 as of December31, 2024.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
However, given NuScale Corps current tax situation we conclude the liability is not probable, and thus no liability related to projected obligations under the TRA has been recorded.
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
As part of the Transaction, NuScale Corp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of NuScale LLC, a variable interest entity (VIE). As the sole managing member of NuScale LLC, NuScale Corp has both the power to direct the activities, and direct ownership to share in the revenues and expenses of NuScale LLC. As such, all the activity of NuScale LLC has been consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet are that of NuScale LLC, other than the Warrants and certain prepaid assets. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Changes in Presentation
For the year ended December31, 2023, 1,855 was reclassified out of Other expenses and into RD expenses to conform to the current year presentation, while for December31, 2022, amounts totaling 4,246 and 3,504 were reclassified out of GA expenses and into RD expenses and Other expenses, respectively.
For the year ended December31, 2022, sponsored cost share totaling 177 that was previously included in Interest income has been reclassified to Sponsored cost share to conform to the current year presentation on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. No such reclassifications were required for the 2023 fiscal year.
Subsequent Events
The Company follows the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 855, Subsequent Events, for disclosing subsequent events. These subsequent events are disclosed in note 4, note 14 and note 17, which are the footnotes they are applicable to.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. NuScale believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as, but not limited to, depreciation, amortization, in-process research and development (IPRD), asset valuations, equity-based compensation and contingencies are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as amounts reported on the statements of operations during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash equivalents represent short-term, highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less at time of purchase. Cash equivalents with an initial maturity of between three and twelve months at time of purchase are presented as short-term investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit. These certificates of deposit are classified as held-to-maturity, and the estimated fair value of the investment approximates its amortized cost.
Cash in the amount of 5,100 is restricted as collateral for the letter of credit associated with the Release Agreement with CFPP LLC at December31, 2024 and December31, 2023. Previous to that, the letter of credit was associated with the DCRA, which spanned multiple years requiring the amount be classified as a noncurrent asset at December31, 2022. The Company expects the Release Agreement will be finalized during the 2025 fiscal year resulting in the related restricted cash being classified as a current asset, identified as Restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. The Restricted cash balance plus Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet equals cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
Sales and Marketing Agreements
The Company has entered into various sales and marketing agreements pursuant to which we prepaid certain expenses to the counterparty. As of December31, 2023, the balance of 15,000 is included in Prepaid expenses, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and was amortized monthly on a straight-line basis through the period ended December 31, 2024. As of December31, 2024, the Company had no significant prepaid sales and marketing agreements.
Accounts and Other Receivables
Accounts and other receivables include reimbursement requests outstanding from cost share agreements with various entities, interest receivable and commercial accounts receivable associated with other federal projects. The reimbursement requests outstanding from DOE awards are recognized as eligible costs are incurred. Reimbursement under the awards are included in Sponsored cost share in the consolidated statements of operations.
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for credit losses. Management estimates an allowance for credit losses by evaluating customer-specific conditions, including adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to pay, as well as both microeconomic and macroeconomic factors.
In-process Research and Development
IPRD represents incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of their acquisition date in 2011. Due to the nature of IPRD, the expected life is indefinite, and it will be evaluated periodically for attainment of technological feasibility or impairment. Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features and technical performance requirements. IPRD was concluded to include both fundamental and defensive technologies comprised of OSU-licensed and NuScale-owned patented and unpatented technology and trade secrets. Such technologies are designed to work together in the operation of a nuclear power module.
IPRD is amortized over its estimated useful life once technological feasibility is reached. As the Company has not yet completed all designing, coding and testing activities, management has determined that technological feasibility has not yet been reached. Management has not identified any indicators that would suggest any impairment of the IPRD. If IPRD is determined not to have technological feasibility or is abandoned, it will be impaired or written off at such time.
Revenue Recognition
In addition to advancing the commercialization of its SMR, the Company provides engineering and licensing services, while also charging licensing fees to customers.
The Company recognizes fixed price contract revenue with multiple performance obligations as each obligation is completed. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time we recognize revenue when delivery of the promised good has occurred or the service has been rendered. For performance obligations satisfied over time we use the cost to cost input method to estimate the amount to recognize. Revenue recognized on contracts that has not been billed to customers is classified as a current asset under Accounts and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as a current liability under Deferred revenue.
The Company excludes from its measurement of transaction prices all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i)imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii)collected from customers. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of sales.
Customer payments on contracts are typically due within 30 days of billing, depending on the contract.

(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
The Company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Companys work on a project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred, and for the periods presented, no warranty liability has been recorded.
Sponsored Cost Share
As our commercialization activities advance, we have continued to enter into cost share agreements with various entities, including both governmental and private, under which the Company is reimbursed for specific RD activities. As of December31, 2024, these entities include DOE, United States Department of State and United States Trade and Development Agency (combined as USG), CFPP LLC and RoPower Nuclear S.A (RoPower).
Since 2014, the DOE has provided critical funding to the Company through a series of cooperative agreements that support ongoing commercialization activities. During the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, DOE cost share totaled 342, 29,320 and 72,337, respectively.
Beginning in 2021, the Company partnered with USG to develop SMRs in foreign markets. Under USGs technical assistance grant programs, we receive cost share commitments to support licensing work in these foreign markets, one of which is additionally supported by RoPower. During the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, USG cost share totaled 6,204, 23,828 and 177, respectively.
Finally, we received subrecipient cost share from CFPP LLC under a contract between the DOE and UAMPS for RD performed. Under this agreement we received cost share of 338 and 7,883 for the years ended December31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, with no such subrecipient cost share earned prior to this year. No future amounts are expected, as the agreements between NuScale and CFPP LLC have been suspended and wind down procedures initiated.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company uses a three-level hierarchy, which prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).
The levels of hierarchy are described below
Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets and
Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most stringent level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The carrying amount of certain financial instruments, including short-term investments, prepaid expenses and deposits, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to their short maturities.

NuScale Power Corporation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
Property, Plant and Equipment
All additions, including betterments to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation is derecognized with any gain or loss recorded in the year of disposition.
Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over useful lives of seven years. Computer software is depreciated over useful lives of three to five years. Office and computer equipment is depreciated over useful lives of five years. Test equipment is depreciated over useful lives of five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the associated lease.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets including primarily property and equipment and acquired IPRD are reviewed for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying amount will not be recoverable, as determined based on comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount, impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount to fair value.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of a business acquired in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances arise during theyear that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
Warrant Liability
The Company accounted for the Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, under which the Warrants did not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classified the Warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusted the Warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability was subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised or redeemed, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Warrants had been estimated using the Public Warrants quoted market price.
Equity-Based Compensation
Our long-term incentive plan provides for grants of nonqualified or incentive stock options, restricted stock award units (RSUs) and performance-based award units.
Equity-based compensation is measured using a fair value-based method for all equity-based awards. The cost of awarded equity instruments is recognized based on each instruments grant-date fair value over the period during which the grantee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The determination of fair value for nonqualified or incentive stock options requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly with regard to Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price, volatility and expected option lives to value equity-based compensation, while forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The grant date fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the grant date as stated on the NYSE.
The option valuation model used to calculate the Companys options uses the treasury yield curve rates for the risk-free interest rate for a period equal to the expected option life and the simplified method to calculate the expected option life (options qualified as plain vanilla under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin 107). Volatility is determined by
F-13
NuScale Power Corporation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
reference to the actual volatility of several publicly traded companies that are similar to NuScale in its industry sector. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. All equity-based payment awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.
Equity-based compensation is recorded as a General and administrative expense and Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Research and Development
RD expenses represent costs incurred for designing and engineering products, including the costs of developing design tools. All research and development costs related to product development are expensed as incurred.
Advertising and Marketing
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising costs expensed were approximately 19,976, 14,617 and 7,340 for the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Income Taxes
NuScale Corp accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing tax laws and the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, which are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. The amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties. Once identified, the Company will recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions within the provision (benefit) for income taxes line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
NuScale LLC is a limited liability company treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. As such, its net taxable income or loss and any related tax credits are allocated to its members.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) issued by the FASB.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280)  Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 requires all public entities, including public entities with a single reportable segment, to provide in interim and annual periods one or more measures of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Additionally, the standard requires disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items as well as incremental qualitative disclosures.
NuScale adopted ASU 2023-07 effective December 31, 2024, on a retrospective basis. The adoption of 2023-07 did not change the way that the Company identifies its reportable segments and, as a result, did not have a material impact on the Companys segment-related disclosures. Refer to Note 11 for further information on NuScales reportable segment.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740)  Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendment in the ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASUs amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (ASU 2024-03). ASU 2024-03 requires new financial statement disclosures in tabular format, disaggregating information about prescribed categories underlying any relevant income statement expense caption. Qualitative disclosures about any remaining amounts in relevant expense line items must be provided. Separate disclosures of total selling expenses and an entitys definition of those expenses are also required. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

NuScale Power Corporation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
Prior to the Transaction, NuScale LLC issued equity consisting of common units and convertible preferred units (CPUs). Each common unit was entitled to one vote, while holders of CPUs had voting rights equivalent to the number of CPUs held multiplied by a common equivalent ratio, as defined, which was set at 100% at the time of the Companys recapitalization in 2011. The CPUs had a 10.0% cumulative preferred return per year compounded quarterly on the unreturned preferred capital, beginning on the date such CPU was issued. In addition, NuScale LLC had mezzanine equity.
As consideration for the reverse recapitalization, 178,396,711 shares of NuScale Corps Class B common stock were issued. Simultaneously, all NuScale LLC units and CPUs outstanding were reclassified to Class B common stock and additional paid-in capital at carrying value, including NuScale LLC units previously presented as mezzanine equity. In addition, the accumulated preferred return was nullified upon conversion.
Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is based on the average number of shares of Class A common stock used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of RSUs and Stock Options, if any, using the treasury stock method and for all other interests that convert into potential shares of Class A common stock, if any, using the if converted method. Net loss attributable to Class A common stockholders for diluted loss per share is adjusted for the Companys share of NuScale LLCs net loss, net of NuScale Corp taxes, after giving effect to all other interests that convert into potential shares of Class A common stock, to the extent it is dilutive. In addition, net loss attributable to Class A common stockholders for diluted loss per share is adjusted for the after-tax impact of changes to the fair value of warrant liabilities, to the extent the Companys Warrants are dilutive.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock and represents the period where the Company had Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. Class B common stock represents a right to cast one vote per share at the NuScale Corp level, and carry no economic rights, including rights to dividends or distributions upon liquidation, and as a result, is not considered a participating security for basic and diluted loss per share. As such, basic and diluted loss per share of Class B common stock has not been presented.

9. DCRA, LLM Agreement and Release Agreement
During the first quarter of 2023, we entered into the LLM Agreement with CFPP LLC. Related to this contract, the Company has subcontracted for the purchase of certain long-lead materials (LLM) in the amount of 55,700, that were to be used in fabrication of the NPMs as part of the DCRA with CFPP LLC. However, in November 2023, NuScale and CFPP LLC entered into the Release Agreement whereby the DCRA and LLM Agreement would be suspended, while wind down procedures and the ultimate disposition of the long-lead materials would be negotiated between the Company, CFPP LLC and DOE. As part of the Release Agreement, NuScale was required to pay 49,769 to CFPP LLC and provide a letter of credit in the amount of 5,000 for demobilization and wind down costs. This letter of credit is collateralized by 5,100 and included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as Restricted cash as of December31, 2024 and 2023.
Upon final settlement of the LLM Agreement, and once DOE is compensated for its investment in the LLM (stemming from DOEs funding under its cost share agreement with CFPP LLC), NuScale will obtain all rights and obligations of the LLM. As a result of DOEs investment in the LLM, as of December31, 2024 and 2023, NuScale has included a Long-lead material liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 32,327 and 32,323, respectively, for the estimated cost to gain 100% of the LLM, once completed. The LLM represents in-process inventory recorded at cost and is identified as Long-lead material work in process on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 43,388 and 36,361 as of December31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
10. Intangible Assets and Redeemable Common Units
In 2007, NuScale LLC entered into a patent license agreement (the Agreement) with OSU, which granted NuScale LLC a worldwide, exclusive license under three patents. In 2015, NuScale LLC entered into a Purchase, Sale and License Agreement (PLA) with OSU, whereby OSU sold and assigned to NuScale LLC certain patent and intellectual property rights, including the patent intellectual property rights that OSU formerly exclusively and non-exclusively licensed to NuScale LLC under the Agreement and granted NuScale LLC a license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute, transmit, publicly perform and publicly display the testing data.
As consideration of this purchase, NuScale LLC issued a cash payment of 1,000 upon execution of the agreement as well as on-going 25 quarterly cash payments continuing until the earlier of (i)such time as NuScale LLC completes the sale of
F-19
NuScale Power Corporation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
its first commercial-scale nuclear module (exclusive of modules designated to validate the operability of a NuScale module) to a commercial customer or (ii)expiration of the term of the last valid claim under the assigned patents to expire. Additionally, NuScale LLC will make royalty payments to OSU on the sale of NuScale LLCs first and subsequent commercial-scale nuclear modules to a commercial customer as follows
0.25% of the then current commercial price paid to NuScale LLC for the first twenty-four (24) NuScale modules sold to commercial customers.
0.15% of the then current commercial price paid to NuScale LLC for the next twelve (12) NuScale modules sold to commercial customers.
Under the initial PLA, NuScale LLC granted OSU 2,750,000 NuScale LLC common units valued at a weighted average price per unit of 0.25 determined on their respective grant date. Additionally, under the updated agreement, NuScale LLC granted OSU 3,250,000 NuScale LLC common units valued at 0.45 per unit on the grant date, resulting (in addition to the cash payment of 1,000) in a value assigned to the patents of 2,462 which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patents which is estimated to be through 2034. The gross carrying amount of the patents was 2,462 for each year included in our consolidated balance sheet herein. The accumulated amortization for the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are 1,757, 1,580 and 1,403, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeedingyears is expected to be 177 peryear.
Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021, the 6,000,000 NuScale LLC common units subject to possible redemption are presented as mezzanine equity, outside of Members Equity. Upon consummation of the Transaction, these 6,000,000 NuScale LLC common units were converted into NuScale LLC Class B units and an equivalent number of shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock were issued and are now included in consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity.
Commencing on the effective date of the Agreement and continuing until such time as NuScale LLC completes the sale of its first commercial-scale nuclear module to a commercial customer, OSU shall have the right, but not the obligation, to sell all of its then current common share holdings in NuScale Holdings and all of its then current common stock in NuScale Corp (collectively the NuScale Shares) to NuScale LLC if, but only if, the NRC issues a written determination that  (a)OSUs ownership of the NuScale Shares creates a conflict of interest for OSU and (b)OSU must divest the entirety of such NuScale Shares in order to continue performing work on NuScale LLCs behalf for certification of the NuScale reactor design. In the event OSU exercises such option, the parties shall enter into a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to each party, pursuant to which OSU would agree to sell and NuScale LLC would agree to purchase all of the NuScale Shares for a price equal to the then current market value of the NuScale Shares.
11. Segment Information
The Company presently operates in one business segment, the commercialization of a modular, scalable electric Light Water Reactor nuclear power plant, with 77 megawatt (gross) NPMs. In the future the Company also plans to generate revenue by providing critical services, such as start-up and testing and nuclear fuel and refueling services, over the life cycle of each power plant. However, at the Companys current stage, all significant revenue generated to date arises from engineering and licensing fees and services provided to potential customers, with the end goal of selling NPMs.
The Company has determined that its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are its chief operating decision makers (CODM). During the 2024 fiscal year these individuals made decisions on resource allocation, assess performance of the business and monitor budget versus actual results using Net loss, which is provided in the accompanying statements of operations. These measures are used to allocate resources for business activities on a consolidated basis as the Company operates in one reportable segment. The Company does not use a measure of segment assets in its decision making. When evaluating how to allocate resources, CODMs primarily focus on salaries and wages, which are the significant expenses within Loss from operations and Net loss. Salaries and wages, totaled 69,130, 93,861 and 74,626 for the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively and are included in all three of the Companys operating expense line items on the consolidated statements of operations.
12. Revenue
As described above in note 3, the Company generally recognizes revenue either at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of the performance obligations within the contracts. As the Company moves towards commercialization of a
F-20
NuScale Power Corporation
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
modular, scalable electric Light Water Reactor nuclear power plant, it enters into engineering, design, and licensing services contracts to assist in the development of nuclear power plants that are often unique and non-standard in nature. Identifying the separate performance obligations with the revenue contracts and determining the amount of revenue that should be recognized involves judgment due to the unique and non-standard nature of the contracts the Company enters into.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, NuScale executed a contract with Fluor, to provide sub-contract engineering and design services to support the Doicesti project FEED Phase 2. The contract has a stated contract value of 35,300. Due to a termination clause within the contract, the Company will recognize revenue over time to the extent work is performed. As required by GAAP, we constrain any portion of revenue that we do not expect to recover. We are entitled to all work performed and recognized to date under the termination clause.
NuScale has also executed contracts that include variable consideration. The variable consideration is recognized subject to appropriate constraints, as required by GAAP, to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in future periods. Management reviews the Companys variable consideration on at least a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2024, the Company has estimated variable consideration outstanding of 5,000, all of which is expected to be recognized during 2025.
Revenue is disaggregated below by the different services currently provided by the Company

Under the provisions of the 401(k)Plan, the Company matches the employees contributions for the first 3% of compensation and matches 50% of the employees contributions for the next 2% of compensation. The expense for the 401(k)Plan was 2,098, 2,691 and 2,511 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
14. Equity-Based Compensation
The total compensation expense recognized for common share options and time-based RSU awards during the years ended December31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 13,642, 16,239 and 10,821, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2024, equity-based compensation of 6,581 was included in GA expense and 7,061 was included in Other expense, compared to 6,509 and 9,730, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2023, and 5,197 and 5,624, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2022.
Options to purchase common units of NuScale LLC under the Fourth Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan of NuScale LLC (the Legacy Plan) were granted, before completion of the Transaction, at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the NuScale LLC units at the date of grant. In connection with the Transaction, all outstanding options to purchase NuScale LLC units converted into options to purchase 14,742,933 shares of NuScale Corp Class A common stock with no change to the remaining vesting schedule. Shares underlying those options, and an additional 17,760,961 shares of Class A common stock issuable under the Companys 2022 long-term incentive plan (2022 LTIP), were registered on a registration statement on Form S-8, filed with the SEC on July 5, 2022. Except with respect to equity awards outstanding as of the completion of the Transaction, the Legacy Plan terminated on May 2, 2022, and no further equity awards will be made, or have been made since, under the Legacy Plan.

(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)
Unit options granted became exercisable 25% after one year of service and on a monthly basis over three years of service thereafter. In February 2014, the Board of Managers of NuScale LLC approved amendments to NuScale LLCs Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan and unit option agreements. The amendments generally allowed terminated and retiring employees with over five years of service to NuScale LLC an extended period of time, up to the expiration of the option, during which to exercise their fully vested options when employment ceases.
Under the Companys 2022 LTIP, the Company granted both RSUs and common share options (Share Options) to employees during the year ended December31, 2024. The Share Options become exercisable, and RSUs vest, one-third after each year of consecutive service over the three year period from the date of the award. New independent Directors receive a one-time award that vests quarterly over three years, while independent Directors receive an annual award that vests quarterly over one year.
Effective January 1, 2023, the share pool was automatically increased by 8,972,128, which is the number of shares of Class A common stock equal to four percent (4%) of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding on December 31, 2022, excluding any such outstanding shares of Class A common
stock that were granted under the 2022 long-term incentive plan and remain unvested and subject to forfeiture as of December 31, 2022.
The Company measures the fair value of each share option grant at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Common Unit Appreciation Rights
In 2013, NuScale LLC granted its Chief Executive Officer 1,000 common unit appreciation rights (UARs). The UARs vested one-third eachyear on the anniversary of the grant date. Upon exercise of a UAR, the holder would receive common units equal to the excess of the fair value of the common units over the strike price of 0.11 at the grant date multiplied by the number of rights exercised and divided by the fair value of the common unit upon exercise. In February 2022, the NuScale LLC Board of Managers approved a 1,540 cash payment (paid during the three months ended June 30, 2022) in lieu of equity issuance related to the UARs, which triggered recognition of 1,490 of equity-based compensation expense, included in GA expenses.
15. Income Taxes
As of December31, 2024, NuScale Corp holds 44.3% of the economic interest in NuScale LLC, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, NuScale Power, LLC is itself generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws as its net taxable income (loss) and any related tax credits are passed through to its members and included in their tax returns, even though such net taxable income (loss) or tax credits may not have actually been distributed. NuScale Power Corp is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to its distributive share of the net taxable income (loss) and any related tax credits of NuScale

Power, LLC. For the days and periods prior to the Transaction, NuScale Power, LLC was a partnership. As such, its net taxable loss and any related tax credits were allocated to its members.
The Company incurred 1,935 in foreign withholding tax expense for the year ended December31, 2024, while incurring no income tax expense for the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years. Of this amount, the majority of the income tax expense was incurred in the country of Romania, with only a nominal amount paid to a separate foreign taxing authority. NuScale has not incurred any domestic income tax expense in any year included herein.
A reconciliation of income tax expense with amounts computed at the federal statutory tax rate is as follows
		Year Ended December 31, 2024		Year Ended December 31, 2023
Computed tax (21%)			(72,755)				(37,824)

The Company has assessed the realizability of the net deferred tax assets, and in that analysis, has considered the relevant positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent results of operations. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred by NuScale Power, LLC over the three year period ended December31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth. After consideration

of all these factors, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets at NuScale Power Corp as of the Transaction and as of December31, 2024, which will be maintained until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The initial recognition of the Companys deferred tax assets and valuation allowance in connection with the Transaction was recorded to Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. As noted above, the valuation allowance completely offset the deferred tax assets of NuScale Power Corp, which resulted in a net zero impact to the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of the Transaction.
As of December31, 2024, the Company had tax effected U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) and credit carryforwards totaling 25,415, which do not expire, as well as state NOL carryforwards totaling 4,620, which have various expiration dates extending through 2042. Under IRC Section 382, when a corporation undergoes an ownership change, its capacity to utilize historic net operating loss carryforwards against post-change taxable income or tax liability might be limited. Based on the number of Class A common shares sold and the exercise of the Warrants during the 2024 fiscal year, it is likely that the Company does have a limitation under IRC Section 382. Although the impact is still being evaluated, if an ownership change occurred in 2024, it is likely that the amount of NOL that could be deducted in each subsequent year would be reduced.
The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. To the extent the Companys assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which the determination is made. As of December31, 2024, the Company has not recorded any uncertain tax positions, as well as any accrued interest and penalties on the consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December31, 2024, the Company did not record any interest and penalties in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Companys income tax filings will be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The Company will monitor the status of U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns that may be subject to audit in future periods. No U.S. federal, state, and local income tax returns are currently under examination by the respective taxing authorities.

and the other defendants filed a reply on February 14, 2023. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was held on May 17, 2023. On August 3, 2023, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation that recommended that NuScale LLCs motion to dismiss be denied. On August 17, 2023, NuScale LLC filed an objection to this report and recommendation. On November 13, 2023, the District Court Judge entered an order accepting the report and recommendation. On December 8, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint, and on June 23, 2024, the Court denied this motion. Subsequent to year end, on February 13, 2025, the parties resolved the lawsuit and the complaint has been dismissed with prejudice.
Multiple shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the Company and certain of its current or former officers, namely John Hopkins, Chris Colbert, Robert Hamady and Clayton Scott (1) Sigman v. NuScale Power Corp., et al. (Case No. 23-1689, filed November 15, 2023), and (2) Ryckewaert v. NuScale Power Corp., et al. (Case No. 23-1956, filed December 26, 2023). These lawsuits assert virtually identical allegations and claims and were consolidated before the same judge on February 2, 2024. The lawsuits assert claims under the federal securities laws and allege that the Company and members of management made materially false andor misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Companys business, operations and prospects, and specifically about certain of the Companys agreements with customers. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 18, 2024 that makes similar allegations as the original complaints. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on June 17, 2024, and plaintiff filed a brief in opposition on August 1, 2024. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs indicated they intended to seek leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to add allegations relating to the Companys disclosure about the SEC inquiry disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Part II  Other Information, Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Defendants consented to plaintiffs request to amend, with the express caveat that defendants believed the proposed amendment to be futile and defendants would move to dismiss any Second Amended Complaint, including any new allegations. On September 20, 2024, plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint, and on November 1, 2024, defendants moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs responded to Defendants motion to dismiss on December 17, 2024, and Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss on January 24, 2025. The motion is now pending and awaiting a decision. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company does not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the Company has not recorded any liability as a result of these actions.
On December 10, 2024, a purported class action lawsuit titled Tucker v. NuScale Power Corporation, et al., Case No. 2024-1272-NAC (Del. Ch. Ct.) was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The lawsuit names the Company, eight current board members and one former board member as defendants. The lawsuit broadly alleges that the Companys corporate opportunity waiver provision contained in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation is overbroad and impermissibly waives certain fiduciary duties in contradiction to state statutory law. The named plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, certification as class representative, and costs, fees and damages for a to-be certified class of plaintiffs. This lawsuit is in its early stages.
In December 2023, the Company received a voluntary request from the SECs Denver Regional Office for information relating to its employment, severance, and confidentiality agreements.

In connection with DOE and UAMPS Award 8935, DOE designated NuScale as a subrecipient to UAMPS for the production of NPM 1, while classifying NuScale as a contractor or subcontractor for NPMs 2-12. As part of DOEs classification of NuScale as a contractor or subcontractor for NPMs 2-12, DOE noted that should NuScale fail to initiate commercial operation of NPM 1, DOE has the right to demand repayment of the fees invoiced for NPMs 2-12. We have established a LLM liability on the consolidated balance sheet associated with this right in the amount of 32,327.
